&lt;p>There are three possible levels of preparation. Depending on your
(self-reported) level of preparation you will join one or another discussion
group.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I encourage you to read the texts carefully, optimizing for quality rather than
quantity and take some notes to use during the discussion.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The preparation time is estimated using the word count of the articles and
assuming a reading speed of 270 words / minute plus some extra time for
reflection and note taking.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="preparation-basic">Preparation: Basic&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Anyone who comes unprepared to the meetup will read the following articles
&lt;strong>during the meetup&lt;/strong>. Nonetheless, I encourage you to read the texts
beforehand and re-read them on Friday. I will provide printed copies and links.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Estimated preparation time: 20 - 30 minutes.&lt;/p>

&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h2 id="what-will-we-do">What will we do?&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Sometimes people ask half-jokingly whether rationality is a cult. The answer
(at least for Rationality Freiburg) is of course: no. But&amp;hellip; isn&amp;rsquo;t that exactly
what a cult member would say? Yes, of course! And isn&amp;rsquo;t it also the case that a
cult member might recognize other groups as cults but would rarely see that
they themself belong to a cult? Yes! So, where does that leave us? Well, it&amp;rsquo;s
a valid concern and in fact as our supreme leader &lt;em>Eliezer Yudkowsky&lt;/em> wrote in
our holy book &lt;em>The Sequences&lt;/em> (yes, that was irony):&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>[&amp;hellip;] every Cause wants to be a cult. It’s a high-entropy state into which the
system trends, an attractor in human psychology. It may have nothing to do
with whether the Cause is truly Noble. You might think that a Good Cause
would rub off its goodness on every aspect of the people associated with
it—that the Cause’s followers would also be less susceptible to status games,
ingroup-outgroup bias, affective spirals, leader-gods. But believing one true
idea won’t switch off the halo effect. A noble cause won’t make its adherents
something other than human.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/s/M3TJ2fTCzoQq66NBJ/p/yEjaj7PWacno5EvWa">source&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>And as Kaj Sotala wrote:&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>I’m reminded of something I recall Eliezer Yudkowsky once saying: “if you
tell your doting followers not to form a cult, they will go around saying ‘We
Must Not Form A Cult, Great Leader Mundo Said So’.”&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/o9dnstYoc7cwpgdhg/unwitting-cult-leaders">source&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So what we will do today is discuss cults and cultishness.&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Do human groups have a natural tendency towards cultishness? If so, why is
that?&lt;/li>
&lt;li>What can be done to avoid it? How would we recognize if it happens?&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Does cultishness include characteristics that are valuable? Is it possible to
take those characteristics and avoid the problems?&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>The modality of the meetup will be: We will divide into multiple 5 person
groups depending on the level of preparation. Those in the &amp;ldquo;Basic&amp;rdquo; group will
read their articles during the meetup because it includes all people who came
unprepared. In the end we will form one big discussion circle to share some
insights and do a practical exercise named &amp;ldquo;Dissent Collusion&amp;rdquo; that can be
summarizes as: Take turns being confronted with a group that’s presenting a
united front, and grow comfortable agreeing or disagreeing with them.&lt;/p>

&lt;h2 id="preparation">Preparation&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>I &lt;strong>strongly recommend&lt;/strong> you do the following things. Nevertheless, I will
assume some people have not done them and give time and instructions to do it
during the meetup. So even if you don&amp;rsquo;t have time to prepare, come anyway! Why
should you do it before? Because it&amp;rsquo;s not the same having 20% of people needing
assistance during the live setup than having 100%.&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Bring an &lt;strong>electronic device&lt;/strong> to the event, either a laptop, an Android
phone/tablet or an iPhone/iPad. If you have no device you can participate by
using paper flashcards that I&amp;rsquo;ll provide or collaborate with someone that has
an electronic device.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Install Anki&lt;/strong> (Windows/Linux/macOS/Android/iOS) on the device you are
bringing: &lt;a href="https://apps.ankiweb.net/#download">https://apps.ankiweb.net/#download&lt;/a> (Note that the iOS app for
iPhone/iPad costs $25 - money well spent so I encourage you to buy it - but
everything else is free).&lt;/li>
&lt;li>If Anki is already installed please ensure you &lt;strong>update&lt;/strong> to the latest
version (for PC 23.10.1, AnkiDroid for Android 2.16.5, AnkiMobile for iOS
23.10)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Sign up&lt;/strong> for AnkiWeb (free): &lt;a href="https://ankiweb.net/account/signup">https://ankiweb.net/account/signup&lt;/a>&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Optional&lt;/strong> additional preparation:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Read about some key concepts:
&lt;a href="https://docs.ankiweb.net/getting-started.html#key-concepts">https://docs.ankiweb.net/getting-started.html#key-concepts&lt;/a>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Very thorough article on spaced repetition including data and research:
&lt;a href="https://gwern.net/spaced-repetition">https://gwern.net/spaced-repetition&lt;/a>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Michael Nielsen (a famous quantum physicist and computer scientist) explains
how he uses Anki (e.g. to read research papers) and gives background
information. This article probably motivated myself to get started with Anki
a few years ago. &lt;a href="https://augmentingcognition.com/ltm.html">https://augmentingcognition.com/ltm.html&lt;/a>&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h2 id="what-will-we-do">What will we do?&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>I have been using Anki for 1279 days, every day (ok, I missed around 10 days
total). That&amp;rsquo;s 3 and a half years. It has been one of the single most
significant improvements in my life.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I will explain what spaced repetition is, how it works and how you can leverage
it to remember anything you want to remember for as long as you want to.
Memorization has a bad reputation but in fact every thought and creative
insight you have, uses memories stored in your brain. Reading a book and being
able to remember the core ideas years down the line is valuable. Attaching
names to concepts is valuable. I will show many concrete examples of how and
why I use Anki, pitfalls where I ran into difficulties and lessons I learnt.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Last but not least I will guide you in starting using Anki during the meetup.
You will install it on your device (if at all possible, please do this before
the meetup, see the &amp;ldquo;Preparation&amp;rdquo; section above). You will then take a piece of
text and convert it into good Anki cards. Creating Anki cards is easy. Creating
good cards is hard. Your success will hinge in making a habit out of using Anki
and on having great cards.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>What can you use Anki for? For studying any subject (school, university,
privately). To summarize books, articles or research papers. To test yourself
on small exercises. Some examples from my collection:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Names of people, using their photographs&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Food allergies, names of children and spouses of friends&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Small mathematical exercises (e.g. what is the derivative of f(x) = (3-6x)^5?
Two cards will be dealt off the top of a well-shuffled deck. What is the
chance that the first card will be the seven of clubs and the second card
will be the queen of hearts?)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Important phone numbers&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Vocabulary and phrases in multiple languages&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Grammatical rules&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Correct spelling of words (e.g. desert/dessert, ocurred/occured/occurred)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Meaning of words/expressions (e.g. gregarious, dichotomy, fatuous, to suss
something out)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Ingredients for favorite cooking recipes&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Computer shortcuts (e.g. how to drag the selected but hidden object in
Inkscape?)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Identifying keys, intervals and notes in sheet music&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Core ideas from books (e.g. from Dale Carnegie&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;How to Win Friends &amp;amp; Influence
People&amp;rdquo;: Take care to [&amp;hellip;] people’s names [&amp;hellip;])&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&amp;hellip;&lt;/li>

&lt;p>Entropy is a fundamental concept in physics that has wide ranging applications
within as well as outside of physics.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In this talk Nawid is going to shine a light on this very elusive concept and
(try to) explain it in an intuitive way. Goal of this talk is to leave with a
better understanding of ideas related to information theory, the arrow of time
or the heat death of the universe.&lt;/p>

discussion round afterwards.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Felix Böcker (Head of the Monitoring Division, FVA Wildlife Institute, Lynx and
Wolf Department) will give a talk and answer questions. Afterwards we will
identify some opinions where people differ on this topic and practice &amp;ldquo;Double
Crux&amp;rdquo; to identify the roots of the disagreement.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Originally, the wolf was native to the entire Northern Hemisphere. The decline
in habitats and deliberate reduction of populations led to the extinction of
the wolf in large parts of Europe and other continents.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>For several decades now, an elevated protection status has enabled the wolf to
reintroduce itself to formerly inhabited regions. In the year 2000, the first
reproduction in Germany was documented once again. Since then, the wolf has
continued to spread in Germany. In 2021/2022, 230 wolf territories were counted
in Germany (Source: DBBW). However, with the return of the wolf and its
scientific monitoring, many aspects and questions have emerged. One of the
primary challenges is livestock farming. Controversies in nature and species
protection also contribute to ongoing discussions in society, for example.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This presentation aims to provide insight into the current state of knowledge
regarding wolf monitoring and to highlight questions and discussions related to
the topic of wolves.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Double crux is an exercise done in pairs where the goal is first to find an
issue where you have a disagreement and then identify the fundamental root
cause of that disagreement. It&amp;rsquo;s not about confrontation or discussing the
issue, but &lt;strong>collaborating&lt;/strong> to find that &lt;em>crux&lt;/em> that is making you disagree.
For example two people might disagree on wearing sandals with socks. After some
collaborating they find that the crux of their disagreement is how much
importance they assign to following tacit social norms. They could then dig
even deeper why these social norms are important or why they feel important.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>There always is a mix of German and English speakers and we configure the

itself will be in German but we will do live translations as needed.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This meetup will be hosted by Felix.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Meeting place is at 10:00 a.m. on platform 7 (check whether there is a change
for S1) at Freiburg main train station. Please arrive earlier if you need a
ticket and/or want to discuss buying a group ticket. We will take the S1 to
Kirchzarten (leaves at 10:10 a.m.) and from there a bus to St. Märgen.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The hike will start in St. Märgen shortly after 11 a.m. and we will walk to
Zweribach-Wasserfälle and from there back to St. Märgen. It&amp;rsquo;s a total of 14.3
km with 530m of elevation change. According to Komoot the difficulty is
&amp;ldquo;intermediate&amp;rdquo; and it should take around 4:45 hours. We will take breaks on the
way.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Delve into the mystical depths of Daoism, the frontiers of Artificial
Intelligence, and the mysteries of consciousness with our enlightening
30-minute interactive talk!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Discover how the ancient philosophy of Daoism - with its tenets of harmony,
balance, and intuitive action - can illuminate the pathways of AI development.
Imagine an AI that&amp;rsquo;s not just algorithmically advanced but also adaptable and
intuitive - an embodiment of Daoist principles!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Ever wondered about the role of &amp;lsquo;attention&amp;rsquo; in shaping human consciousness?
We&amp;rsquo;ll explore how this fundamental driver could be the missing link to creating
human-like consciousness in AI.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Our exploration doesn&amp;rsquo;t end there! Embark on a journey into the realm of
phenomenology, the study of human experience. Uncover the profound implications
of this philosophical discipline on how AI could interact with, learn from, and
perhaps even understand the world.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Join us for this incredible intersection of philosophy, meditation, and
advanced technology. Ideal for philosophers, meditation experts, and graduate
students, but open to anyone with a thirst for knowledge. Enlighten your mind,
broaden your horizons, and embrace the future of AI through the lens of ancient
wisdom! Don&amp;rsquo;t miss this unique opportunity!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>After the presentation we will split into one or multiple discussion rounds to
talk about the ideas that were presented.&lt;/p>

through why we hold that this is true – or if we disagree, why we hold that

it. For many reasons having a good mastery of statistics is important e.g. to
follow the scientific discourse.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Goal: Achieve mastery of the material covered in a standard &amp;ldquo;Statistics 101&amp;rdquo;
college course. Mastery means something a little beyond just being able to
theoretically pass an exam, rather actually getting a good intuitive grasp of
the material.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We are working through the text book &amp;ldquo;Statistics&amp;rdquo; by Freedman, Pisani and Purves.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If you are interested in joining the study group please come to a &lt;a href="https://www.rationality-freiburg.de/events/">meetup&lt;/a> first.&lt;/p>
&lt;h1 id="process">Process&lt;/h1>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>We go chapter by chapter.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Everyone studies the chapter on their own and does all the exercises, to the
best of their ability.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>We ask questions in a Signal messenger group and share resources (links,
videos) that help with particular parts.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>One person prepares the entire chapter as the teacher. We rotate who that
person is for each chapter.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>All the others are the students. They each prepare one hard question to test the
teacher on the material.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>We meet every two weeks for two hours:
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>The teacher explains the entire chapter in 30 minutes. Everyone in theory
already knows everything so its most beneficial for the teacher themself,
but it is good re-inforcement for everyone.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The teacher hides one lie in their lecture.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The students have to find the lie.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The students ask the teacher their question to verify the teacher&amp;rsquo;s
knowledge.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>We discuss any parts of the material or exercises that were unclear to
anyone.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Finally, we eat something and relax 😊.&lt;/li>

&lt;p>Read the following post:&lt;/p>

&lt;/ul>
&lt;h2 id="what-will-we-do">What will we do?&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>The Stag Hunt is a bit of game theory, similar to the more popularly known
Prisoner&amp;rsquo;s Dilemma. The idea is that a group of hunters are going out, and they
can either cooperate to hunt Stag for a large benefit that only works if
everyone chooses it, or individually hunt Rabbit for a small benefit that works
even if not everyone agrees. Cooperation is harder than we think; not everybody
is always on the same page about what we’re trying to do. Staggering Hunters is
a gamified version of this! We’re going to play the game, then discuss how it
went and try again to see if we can do better.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We will discuss the post linked above and the implications for our own lives.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="organization">Organization&lt;/h2>

&lt;p>We will decide on using German or English as the main language depending on the

&lt;p>This meetup will be hosted by Omar.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>There will be snacks and drinks.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We will go and get dinner after the meetup. Anyone who has time is welcome to

&lt;p>Three people will give a short (10 minute) presentation on an interesting topic
of their choice. In the presentation they will hide 7 things that are false.
The listeners take notes to try to detect these falsehoods.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>After each presentation the players in turn explain what they think the lies
were. The presenter can then convince them of the contrary. Presenters get
points for making people believe lies and for making them doubt true facts.
Listeners get points for identifying the lies.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The presenters will get the maximum number of points if each of their lies is
identified by exactly one listener. This way the presenter has an incentive to
make the lies hard but not impossible to spot.&lt;/p>

&lt;h2 id="what-will-we-do">What will we do?&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>We will discuss a few of the posts in small groups.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Then we will do a &amp;ldquo;Small Identity&amp;rdquo; exercise.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Our identity is a very interesting phenomenon. We seem to carry an idea in our
head about who we are, what kind of person we are and what that means about us.
Identity is both valuable and dangerous at various times. Identity comes from
our history and our experiences. It is both our scars and the ideas we would
die on a hill for.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In some senses the identity of being &amp;ldquo;righteous person&amp;rdquo; might net you all kinds
of rewards and guidance in situations where you have to decide to &amp;ldquo;do the right
thing&amp;rdquo;&amp;hellip; BUUT it might also lead you to kill people in the name of your
religion.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Paul Graham says, &lt;a href="http://paulgraham.com/identity.html">&amp;ldquo;keep your identity
small&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a>. The book &amp;ldquo;Transform yourself&amp;rdquo;
includes some guidance to change your identity or your beliefs about yourself.
The main exercise is from Psychiatrist Irvin Yalom but is a mix of those
resources and a few more.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This exercise is to help us to be comfortable shedding things that are part of
our identity. If they are no longer useful.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It is hard to think clearly about parts of your identity. To grow, you must
change. Let things go when they don&amp;rsquo;t work for you.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The idea for the exercise and the above description are from
&lt;a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/users/elo">Eliot&lt;/a>, who organizes meetups and
workshops in Sydney, Australia.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Science or the scientific method is not something reserved for people with
white coats in laboratories. Rather, it is a way of thinking you can apply to
your life each and every day.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We will discuss ways of applying the scientific method and then design concrete
experiments people can run on their own. Such experiments could involve
gardening (which plants grow best in what kind of soil or light?), your cooking
(what method is best for getting the perfect boiled potatoe?), people (how will
colleagues react to different kinds of snacks at different times of the day?),
your own mood or psychological state (how does your evening activity affect how
you feel when waking up?), the effect of taking Vitamin D, &amp;hellip;&lt;/p>

&lt;p>We will meet at Holbeinstr, corner with Günterstalstr. You can get there with
the tram 2 (stop Holbeinstraße).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>From here we will walk to Kybfelsen, then to St. Valentin (where we can have a
drink or lunch) and then back to the starting point.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Distance: about 12km with 540m ascent and 540m descent.&lt;/p>

&lt;h2 id="feedback">Feedback&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>After (almost) every event I collected feedback from people. Here is just a
list of things people have said, without any context. Is this useful? Possibly
not, but it might give a general impression whether people enjoy coming (they
do!). It was also noted a few times that negative feedback actually lead to
changes, which was appreciated by participants. If after a feedback it says x3
it means 3 people reported the same.&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>The discussion went off rails at times. The discussion group was too big.
[Solution: Split the group] x3&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Having such a discussion in English is hard. [Solution: Split the group into
German and English]&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Having a public feedback round is not so great. [Solution: Distribute paper
for written feedback]&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Doing something hands-on was very nice.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>The meeting place was great [Stadtgarten].&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>I liked the playful character of the calibration game.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>We should keep some instrumental rationality in every meetup.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Very well prepared, with Snacks etc.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Discussions need to start off a common ground. People may have very different
knowledge. Today it was good.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>A lot of fun.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Good balance of moderation/leading the discussion and letting people discuss
by Omar.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>There was little time to do the Double Crux.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>People came a little late, which initially left me fearing that nobody would
come.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Double Crux does not work well with 3 persons.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Everyone felt that it was a useful technique and that we should do it again
in the future.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>The group size was ideal.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Practical exercises were very good.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>We did not discuss one of the posts that we wanted to and instead went off
topic. We should try to stick to our plan.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>I liked your and X’s contributions a lot and most other people were good too.
One person was terrible and I don’t know how to manage people like that, I
think you did your best. I liked everyone else. The structure was pretty good
and your moderating was pretty good, I’d just echo what other people said
about time allocation.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Overton Gymnastics is a good exercise!&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Very interesting to see a meetup with people who are all quite new to
rationality!&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>The game [exercise] was not well explained at all!!&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>I found the Sequences posts rather boring / not super interesting.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;m not sure if having newbies to rationality in the group is a good idea.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Maybe more moderation?&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Great seeing all of you again!&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Happy to again exchange thoughts with all of you.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>The dynamic of the discussion round was not ideal this time.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Not enough air circulation [because of COVID].&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>We should allocate fixed time slots to every post [to avoid the discussion
getting too deep into other subjects].&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>The group was too large [10 people] for one discussion round.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Discussing three posts [as we did] and not more is ideal.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>We should have split into two groups of five people.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>There was not enough time for the exercise. The discussion should only take
up half the time.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Please arrive 5 minutes before the start to avoid the entire session starting
15 minutes late.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>5 people group size is good. x2&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Prediction game. Manifold Markets. The chosen questions. All very nice.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Well organized.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Interesting experience. I will come back. I was irritated by the music
[coming in through the windows from the street]. The UI from Manifold Markets
is confusing and I won&amp;rsquo;t be using it. 2 hours was too short for the event.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>I was missing a little more &amp;ldquo;instrumental rationality&amp;rdquo; e.g. TAPs.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Giving a short summary of every text is a good custom that we should keep up
[we did not do it this time] for people who have not read the texts. One
person is responsible.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>The goal of the meetup was unclear beforehand. I was unaware it was so
formal. It would have been better to arrive on time. If you host such a
structured meetup it would be better to go all the way and make it even more
formal. Having conversations about [ACX] posts would happen naturally during
dinner anyway.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>I really liked the meetup.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>The exercise was weird.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>I really liked the summaries of the ACX posts.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Thank you for organizing this. I appreciate very much how serious you take
feedback and how attentive you are as a organizer by adapting the meetup
according to it. There is however a risk that catering too much to the
participants could lead to stagnation of the group. Nevertheless, trying to
keep things in flux (for better or worse) is a great quality for an organizer
and is better than sticking only with one formula.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>It was my first time in the group. I think it is very unusual to find people
who try to do such exercises to improve themselves. The exercise [falling
drill] was not very effective because it was clear that it was only a
simulation.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>During the exercise [falling drill] I was in fact wrong about something where
in fact I thought I would be right. That was unexpected, but it was very easy
for me to admit this and that is unusual. Usually it&amp;rsquo;s hard for me to admit a
mistake, but I felt comfortable doing it in this group.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>During the first part of the meetup it would have been better to go deeper
into one or two ACX posts instead of briefly presenting one per person.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>I will return!&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>It was my first time and the first round [discussing ACX posts] was great! It
gave me new things to consider that I had never thought about. Concerning the
game [falling drill] I already train being able to be wrong a lot so I
probably fail more often in the opposite direction [being too unsure], so it
wasn&amp;rsquo;t very effective for me.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>The setting was too artificial for the game [falling drill].&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>I really appreciate your [organizer&amp;rsquo;s] work. We should have spent more time
on the first round [discussing ACX posts]. It was too short.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Forming two groups of 5-6 people was great! The perfect size. In bigger
groups people get lost.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>It was a very nice way of spending the evening.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>I am blown away by the effort you invested in preparing this.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>The accoustics of the room were annoying.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>The group size was ideal.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>The exercise [falling drill] would work better if you had to give confidence
intervals and could be criticized for choosing those badly.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Best: Hike on the next day.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Best: Getting to know new people and discussing our favourite posts from the
ACX/SSC blogs.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Best: Discussing our favourite articles by Scott, and also the hike on the
day after.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Best: The sheer number of new, astonishing insights.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Best: Level of conversation was high.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Best: Improving my ability to say out loud when I&amp;rsquo;m wrong, without feeling
bad about it.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Worst: The room.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Worst: Felt a tiny(!) bit cultish.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Worst: Disturbing political opinions.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Worst: The location was uninspiring.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Worst: The room had bad accoustics.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>I don’t like going to restaurants that much, it’s much more expensive than
what I usually spend on food.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Less structured meetings or a way to branch ideas into spin-off
collaborations in a structured context might make me more excited to come.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Omar is cool. He’s a little obsessed with perfection. He needs to loosen up a
bit. These things take time to grow.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Interesting concepts shared. Rationality is certainly a toolkit that can be
applied in everything and can benefit many people and a lot of lives. But
it’s not universally seen as a good because it’s a competitor to many classic
frameworks like organized religion. So developing a model that competes on
the same playing field is tough.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>The exercise [Hamming circle] was probably helpful for an issue I have been
thinking about for several years.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>I was not so happy that only four people came.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>What you [the organizer] are doing here is really valuable.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>I enjoyed the exercise [Hamming circle]. It made me make up my mind.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>We should keep the exercise part of the meetup.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>I really enjoyed it.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>I liked the Hamming circle very much. Especially having to turn around while
the advisors were discussing, something which I had anticipated I wouldn&amp;rsquo;t
like.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>The discussion round about &amp;ldquo;Trusting experts&amp;rdquo; didn&amp;rsquo;t get to the core of the
issue. It would have required drawing on the whiteboard and a couple of hours
of time.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Acoustics of the room were great.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>TAPs was interesting.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Getting to know cool people.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>I didn&amp;rsquo;t get Occam&amp;rsquo;s razor.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Lack of structure and bad time allocation.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Valuable meeting.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>I liked the mix of discussions and practical things.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>I liked both parts.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Very nice joint event [with EA Freiburg].&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>I learnt something. x2&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Nice mix of input and exercises.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>I am glad it was so interactive.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Interesting. It took longer than expected to get into the subject [long
introduction]. I liked it.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>I liked the refreshed [on probability theory]. Took too long to get started.
It would have been better to define some terms and present a clear agenda for
the evening upfront.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>I liked it. It was a good refresher. I was missing a little the &amp;ldquo;how to apply
it&amp;rdquo; part.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Good mix of presentation and exercises. Good refresher.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Fun and interesting.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>The content of the talk has good applicability to life.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Considering the prior probability of events before evaluating the evidence
was something I had not thought about before.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>I have a better understanding of Bayes&amp;rsquo; theorem now.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Timing was not optimal. It would have been better to have more time to think
about a strategy for the Poker game.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>I realized that I do not think enough about priors.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>You should have focused a little bit more about why our intuition fails us
and how to come to a better intuitive grasp of these concepts.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>It opened new perspectives.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>The talk was well prepared.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>

&lt;/ul>
&lt;h2 id="what-will-we-do">What will we do?&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>We will discuss the two texts, play a game called &amp;ldquo;Cambist Booking&amp;rdquo; and discuss
&amp;ldquo;Units of Exchange&amp;rdquo; and their applicability to our lives.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The &amp;ldquo;Cambist Booking&amp;rdquo; game goes like this: each person will get a some cards
with things you might want on them. You’ll go around asking other people what
their cards are, and deciding how to compare the two values – is a sportscar
worth more or less than a year’s vacation? Is an hour long massage worth more
or less than a new album by your favourite band? We’ll pass out the cards at
the start, keeping some in reserve for new arrivals, and spend the time talking
about what we value and why. &lt;/p>
&lt;p>The lessons taught in Units of Exchange are direct applications of extremely
well- established principles from economics and sociology, such as supply and
demand, Pareto curves, value of information, the sunk cost fallacy, and
arbitrage.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>There will be snacks and drinks.&lt;/p>

&lt;/ul>
&lt;h2 id="what-will-we-do">What will we do?&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>We will continue our discussion on Bayesian thinking while navigating decisions
and how it can help us to avoid many cognitive biases. At the beginning of this
meetup, we will briefly discuss about cognitive biases and Bayes&amp;rsquo; rule with
some examples. You are welcome to bring your personal experience in these two
topics. Followed by that, we will discuss how statistics can be misused to
trick our brains.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>A mathematical background is not necessary, and the goal is to make the subject
very intuitive and simple.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Following the discussion about cognitive biases, we will play some games about
the related topics with the educational purpose of conveying information.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>None.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="what-will-we-do">What will we do?&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>The talk will explain what happens in our body when we are exercising. From
this we will draw conclusions on how to get the maximum positiv effect out of
our invested time. Spoiler alert: To go jogging three times a week for one hour
each is both, highly ineffective, and not enough. The good news is that we can
do better in less time.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This talk is for all who are not into exercising at all up to now but might
also be interesting for others, who want to improve their understanding of the
matter and their efficiency.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>After the talk we will discuss some of the ideas presented and then split into
pairs. Each person in the pair will make a commitment concerning exercise for
the next week and for the next month to the other person. Some form of
communication will be established and each person can then report to their
partner whether they were successful or not after the week/month has passed.&lt;/p>

&lt;h2 id="preparation">Preparation&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>No preparation required - the talk assumes no familiarity wit the field. If you want to, you could watch / listen to the &lt;a href="https://80000hours.org/podcast/episodes/max-tegmark-ai-and-algorithmic-news-selection/">80000 hours episode with Max Tegmark&lt;/a>, in which he discusses his own motivations for engaging in the field and gives some striking examples of why safety should be seriously considered when developing AI systems.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="what-will-we-do">What will we do?&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>We will hear a beginner-friendly talk on AI (Artificial Intelligence) safety by
robotics researcher &lt;a href="https://benjaminalt.github.io/">Benjamin Alt&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The aim of the talk is to give complete beginners in the field of AI solid intuitions and heuristics for thinking about AI systems from a safety perspective. The talk will provide a brief motivation why AI safety is an important concern, even from a short-term perspective. It will give a brief overview of why AI safety is hard, and what aspects of modern AI systems cause safety issues in the first place. It then covers the fundamentals of the assurance, robustness and alignment aspects of AI safety: How can we make sure that we understand what AI systems do? How can we make sure that they reliably do what we think they do? How can we make sure that the AI system&amp;rsquo;s behavior is compatible with our values and preferences?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>There will be interactive parts of this meetup. In the beginning we will brainstorm questions and concerns together. After the talk, there will be a discussion round (or multiple smaller group discussions, depending on the number of people), in which we will try to make sense of what role AI safety may play in our common future.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Free will is the belief that individuals have agency and control over their own
actions, and that they can choose to act or not act in a given situation. It is
the ability to make choices and decisions that are not predetermined by factors
outside of oneself. The concept of free will has been debated by philosophers,
theologians, and scientists for centuries, with some arguing that it is an
illusion while others believe it is essential to our understanding of human
behavior and responsibility. Ultimately, the nature and existence of free will
remain a topic of ongoing debate and discussion. Are we free to choose? Why do
we do the things we do? We will have a friendly discussion about this topic.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>After the discussion we will play &amp;ldquo;The Noticing Game&amp;rdquo;. Two people stand or sit
directly across from each other, making eye contact. One person is A and the
other is B. A goes first. A begins: &amp;ldquo;Sitting/standing here with you, I
notice…&amp;rdquo; B responds, &amp;ldquo;Hearing that, I notice…&amp;rdquo;. It is a deceptively simple but
powerful exercise.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>You can get a headstart by reading the following posts on lesswrong.com about
cognitive biases.&lt;/p>

&lt;/ul>
&lt;h2 id="what-will-we-do">What will we do?&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Cognitive biases are mental shortcuts people use to make sense of the world
around them. In other words, these shortcuts or tendencies our brains use to
process information more efficiently. While they can be helpful in some
situations, they can also lead to systematic errors in thinking and
decision-making. These biases can lead people to make judgments that are not
necessarily accurate or fair, affecting how people perceive, interpret,
remember, and ultimately make decisions.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>At the beginning of this meetup, a short presentation will be followed by
discussions about cognitive biases. This exercise aims to learn more about
biases and build strategies on how to avoid them.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Following the discussion about cognitive biases, we will play some serious
games about the same topic. Well, no need to get scared by the name; serious
games are also fun games that are designed for a specific purpose and not only
for entertainment. They are often used for educational purposes or to convey
information.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>There will be snacks and drinks.&lt;/p>

In doubt we split up the groups into a German and an English part.&lt;/p>

implemented and will not be implemented in this form! There are currently no
meetup rules. The reasons for this is that several people were unhappy about
the proposal and there was a general fear that these rules would be offputting
for new people. Nonetheless, punctuality and preparation are much appreciated.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>What is the purpose of our meetups? Surprisingly, not an easy question to
answer. For me, it is having a place and time where I am challenged, surprised
and intellectually stimulated. Where I feel safe to share a part of myself.
Where I can learn and grow.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This is what I want for myself and what I want to provide for you, the guests,
the participants.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>A gathering is a social contract, even though we frequently resist thinking in
such transactional terms because it seems cold. The organizer gives you
something, or at least promises to, and the participant gives something in
return. Frequently their time and energy, sometimes their money.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The organizer has the privilege and burden of ensuring that the gathering
fulfills its purpose and that every participant gets what they were promised.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Sometimes this is in conflict with what a particular participant wants in a
particular moment.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>For example, if a meetup has started and a round of introduction is through,
everyone has shared a small piece of themselves. An atmosphere of trust and
commitment has been created. And, suddenly, one new person arrives. This new
person will have missed all this introduction, and will therefore, gain less
from the gathering than the others. But, even more, they are also taking away
something from the other participants. There is a small disruption to the
atmosphere that had been created. People don&amp;rsquo;t know this new person. Or even if
they do, they can&amp;rsquo;t sense what mood they bring. The relaxation, the leaving
behind of the world outside, is threatened. So, everyone loses a little bit.
All of this just to benefit the person who came late. They will get 70% of the
benefit of the gathering, at the cost of making it a little bit worse for
everyone else.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The same thing is true if there was an agreement to prepare in some way for the
event. If everyone except one person prepares, then that one person will get
all the benefit of all the work the other people invested, but they themselves
will give nothing in return. It is an unfair trade.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The duty of the organizer is to preserve the atmosphere, the purpose and the
fairness of the gathering. This is an intuition I have had for a long time.
Reading Priya Parker&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;The Art of Gathering&amp;rdquo; made me confident enough to
express and demand it.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I therefore, propose the following rules for our gatherings. I request and want
feedback on and criticism of this proposal, but I won&amp;rsquo;t easily be swayed
because I care, very strongly, about these meetups and their purpose.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>After having expressed some of my thoughts during the last meetup, I already
got feedback from multiple people. I am very grateful for that! That feedback
has helped shape what follows.&lt;/p>
&lt;h1 id="rules-punctuality--preparation">Rules (Punctuality &amp;amp; Preparation)&lt;/h1>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>The rules do not apply to people who come for the first time, because they
can&amp;rsquo;t be expected to know them.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The first 15 minutes of the meetup will be considered arrival time for
informal chatting, snacking and setting up. You may arrive at any time
within those 15 minutes. In order to accomodate this, the meetup duration
will be extended from 2 to 2.5 hours.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>If you arrive 16 minutes or more after the announced start time, you will be
considered &lt;em>latecomer&lt;/em>.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>If you do not prepare for the meetup in the way described in the invitation,
you will be considered &lt;em>unprepared&lt;/em>. This is only based on your own word. If
you say you have prepared, that is good enough, no further proof is required.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>If you are &lt;em>latecomer&lt;/em> or &lt;em>unprepared&lt;/em> you must make a one-time donation to
a charity of your choice.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The amount you must donate is 1% of your monthly income or 1% of your
monthly expenses, whichever is higher. This is only based on your own word.
For example, if on average you earn 2100 € per month and spend 2300 € per
month, you must donate 23 €. You do not need to report any of your finances
to anyone. Calculating the correct amount is entirely up to you.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>If you already donate money to a charity anyway, that does not count. This
donation must be in addition to other donations.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>If you are both &lt;em>latecomer&lt;/em> and &lt;em>unprepared&lt;/em>, you must donate double the
amount.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>You must provide proof of donation (scan, photograph, printscreen) before
you can join a future meetup. If you do not, you will be asked to leave. You
may obfuscate whatever personal information you deem necessary on the proof
of donation, including the amount of the donation.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>You will sign these rules in order to symbolize that you accept them. If
you do not, you will be asked to leave.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>If the amount of preparation required for a meetup is too much or the reading
uninteresting, please give early feedback, so it can be considered. It is
perfectly acceptable to have meetups without any required preparation. We want
to have gatherings that are useful and stimulating, not make you do tedious or
useless work.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The goal of these rules is very clear: Ensure people come on time and well
prepared. If this goal is not reached, then the rules will be adapted e.g. by
increasing the donation amount.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Sequences &amp; TAPs</title><link>https://www.rationality-freiburg.de/events/2022-11-25-sequences-taps/</link><pubDate>Sun, 16 Oct 2022 15:16:42 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://www.rationality-freiburg.de/events/2022-11-25-sequences-taps/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="organization">Organization&lt;/h2>

&lt;h2 id="what-will-we-do">What will we do?&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>It would be ideal to read the three posts beforehand and note your thoughts and
questions, but feel free to turn up even if that is not the case! We will
summarize each post with a discussion in the meeting.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Afterwards, we will give an introduction to TAPs (Trigger-Action-Plan). TAPs
are a technique to create a new intentional habit or break an unwanted habit to
achieve specific goals.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>TAP focuses on a specific noteworthy external trigger which leads to a very
small action. It uses our knowledge from the standard habit model; the
intentions are implemented with an &amp;lsquo;if-then&amp;rsquo; strategy, while a response is
paired with an external trigger.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In the meeting, we will split the group into pairs, and two people will discuss
and collaborate to develop a personal TAP to achieve a specific goal in the
days after the meetup. We will compare the results and experience in
implementing TAPs in a follow-up meetup.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>There will be snacks and drinks.&lt;/p>

&lt;h3 id="prepare-hamming-circle">Prepare Hamming circle&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Think about at least one problem or bottleneck you have in any area of your
life that you might want to discuss with the group. Ideally something you might
be willing to accept other people&amp;rsquo;s advice on, even though of course you have
no obligation to do anything anyone suggests.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="what-will-we-do">What will we do?&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>We will discuss each other&amp;rsquo;s thoughts on the above video &amp;lsquo;Trusting experts&amp;rsquo;.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Then we will do one or several rounds of &lt;a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/xAqRkrnjJTMZ6YmZA/appendix-how-to-run-a-successful-hamming-circle">Hamming
circles&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>A Hamming circle is a tool/process for making some kind of progress on some
large, significant bottleneck.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This is slightly vague, because Hamming circles are versatile.
Participants at CFAR workshops have brought, into their Hamming circles,
all sorts of problems and questions and goals. A sampling:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>How to find a spouse&lt;/li>
&lt;li>What to do about my deteriorating relationship with my teenage child&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Is it possible for me, specifically, to have a meaningful impact on
existential risk&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Something just isn&amp;rsquo;t right about my life&lt;/li>
&lt;li>I need to secure $250,000 in seed funding for my startup&lt;/li>
&lt;li>My partner and I keep having the same fight&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Even though I know I need to exercise, I just keep not exercising&lt;/li>
&lt;li>What if everything I&amp;rsquo;m doing is &amp;ldquo;fake&amp;rdquo; and I&amp;rsquo;m only doing it because I feel
like I&amp;rsquo;m &amp;ldquo;supposed&amp;rdquo; to&lt;/li>
&lt;li>I want to go on a trip. It feels important to go on a trip. But I don&amp;rsquo;t
know why, and I don&amp;rsquo;t know where, and I don&amp;rsquo;t know what this trip should be&lt;/li>
&lt;li>I think I want to quit grad school&lt;/li>
&lt;li>I&amp;rsquo;m expected to speak at my father&amp;rsquo;s funeral and I have nothing but
scathing, bitter, angry things to say&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>What happens in a Hamming circle is fairly similar to what happens in a pair
debug, or even when you&amp;rsquo;re just working through your problems in your own
mind. However, the problems tend to be larger or deeper or more confusing or
intractable, with the hope being that people will bring their most pressing
bottleneck.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>(Though bringing something smaller is fine; there shouldn&amp;rsquo;t be moral pressure
to shoulder a heavier problem than one feels ready to handle.)&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The idea is that, for the duration of the circle, instead of having access to
just one brain&amp;rsquo;s power, each participant will instead have 3-5x their usual
working memory, 3-5x their usual wisdom and life experiences, 3-5x their
usual perspective or field-of-view, 3-5x idea generators or problem solving
strategies, etc.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>There will be snacks and drinks.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>That was the question posed to the entire circle of people sitting in a park in
the center of Berlin. And then one by one people started bragging and everyone
else cheered them on.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="berlin.jpg" alt="Berlin Reichstag at sunset" title="Berlin Reichstag at sunset">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Strictly speaking this happened after the LessWrong Community Weekend during
the &lt;em>Rationality Dojo&lt;/em> that the Berlin Community organized, but it is an
illustrative example of the unusual nature of this event.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If you were to look at the table of talks you would see: dancing, meditation,
how to make fire in the wilderness, kissing workshop, acapella singing, early
morning running, dealing with depression and anxiety, modular origami workshop,
Japanese Mahjong, neurobiology of psychedelics, crochet 101, dark arts intro to
rhetoric, &amp;hellip;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Hardly what one commonly thinks of as &lt;em>rationality&lt;/em>, is it? Well in that case
you would also see multiple talks and workshops about AI (artificial
intelligence) safety, meetup organization, wisdom, probability theory and Fermi
estimates or practical exercises such as &amp;ldquo;Circling&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;Hamming circles&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;Double
Crux&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;Gendlin&amp;rsquo;s Focusing&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>What is more, all of it was organized as an &lt;em>unconference&lt;/em>, meaning that anyone
could add a new event to the schedule at any time or just change their mind and
move it to a different slot.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Let&amp;rsquo;s not forget about Duncan Sabien&amp;rsquo;s (former CFAR - Center for Applied
Rationality - instructor and author of the &lt;a href="https://www.rationality.org/files/CFAR_Handbook_2021-01.pdf">CFAR
handbook&lt;/a>) keynote
speech &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/7WUEnh2TFSk">&amp;ldquo;The moments that matter&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a>, which had to
be delivered via video due to COVID. His key message, that the tools of
Rationality should actually be put into practice instead of theorizing,
especially in the moments where it&amp;rsquo;s hardest, really resonanted with many
participants. Does making the right choices most of the time count for nothing?
It does count, but if in the really crucial moments, the &lt;em>moments that matter&lt;/em>
you keep making the wrong decisions, what is the difference?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="chairs.jpg" alt="Empty chairs are waiting&amp;hellip;" title="Empty chairs are waiting...">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Around 150 people from all over the world, though mostly Europe, showed up and
the entire vibe was inspiring, beautiful and touching. So many fascinating
conversations in the hallways, during lunch or on the way to one of the evening
swims in the lake Wannsee.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Not a single moment of boredom could be another way of putting it. Everyone was
open and welcoming, bringing their own incredible experiences and knowledge to
the table, keeping the minds and hearts of the rest engaged.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Participants were staying in the same hostel, almost entirely booked for us, right
next to the lake, with plenty of food, Mate tea, snacks and board games.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Last but not least, just in case you are wondering about COVID protocol:
Everyone was required to test themselves with the highest quality available
antigen test, provided by the organizers, upon arrival and then every morning
before leaving their room. One of many ways in which the wonderful organizers
worked tirelessly to make the event fantastic for everyone.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Thank you, from the bottom of my heart to every single attendee and organizer!
See you next time!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If you are in or around Freiburg come to the meetups in the next months to
learn much more about the exercises and experiences of this awesome weekend!&lt;/p>

&lt;p>&lt;strong>UPDATE 29.09&lt;/strong> We will meet in &amp;ldquo;Kursraum 1&amp;rdquo; of FlexRooms, right next to
Bertholdsbrunnen in the center of Freiburg.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The room has windows to ensure proper ventilation. Masks are optional.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>You are worried you have nothing to contribute? No worries! Everyone is
welcome!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We will decide on using German or English as the main language depending on the
people who turn up. Just come, we will figure it out!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Maybe you also want to join the &lt;a href="https://www.rationality-freiburg.de/events/2022-10-15-hike-with-karlsruhe-rationality/">hike&lt;/a> on the day after this
event!&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="preparation">Preparation&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Select one or two &lt;a href="https://slatestarcodex.com/">SSC (Slate Star Codex)&lt;/a> or &lt;a href="https://astralcodexten.substack.com/">ACX
(Astral Codex Ten)&lt;/a> posts that you
particularly enjoy so you can give a short summary to other participants.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If you need inspiration check the &lt;a href="https://slatestarcodex.com/top-posts/">SSC top
posts&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="what-will-we-do">What will we do?&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>First there will be one or several (depending on the number of people) free
discussion rounds where people can present their favorite SSC/ACX posts and the
discussion can flow from there.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>After the discussion we will play &amp;ldquo;The Falling Drill&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>One of the most important parts of intellectual progress is learning to change
your mind. The first step of changing your mind is realizing that you were
wrong about something. Today we&amp;rsquo;re going to practice that often painful
realization, in a small way and in a low pressure situation. Without this
skill, how can you debate an important issue or confront a challenging topic?
You might argue long after it&amp;rsquo;s clear to others that you&amp;rsquo;ve lost, because
admitting it feels like defeat.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The first lesson any martial artist learns is often how to fall. There are ways
to make the landing easier, but they all start from the knowledge that falling
isn&amp;rsquo;t the worst thing in the world.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>There will be snacks and drinks. After the event we will go and get dinner
somewhere.&lt;/p>

exercise is becoming more comfortable sharing controversial opinions and

window&lt;/a>, a concept from political
science which describes the set of opinions that are acceptable in public
discourse.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>One person will share a controversial opinion that they hold, the other
participants will ensure they understand that person&amp;rsquo;s position very well,
culminating in an &lt;a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/tag/ideological-turing-tests">ITT (Ideological Turing
Test)&lt;/a> i.e. a
convincing summary of the first person&amp;rsquo;s opinion. Then the next participant
shares a controversial opinion of their own. No discussions allowed.&lt;/p>

you were holding back 😉).&lt;/p>

Armed with hiking boots and epistemic curiosity a car full of
aspiring Freiburger rationalists leaves the train station in Freiburg towards
Bad Herrenalb.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Marcus, one of the founders of the &lt;a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/groups/kw7Zb8DLmZtsK8g3R">Karlsruhe
group&lt;/a> had organized a
beautiful hike that was challenging and beginner friendly at the same time.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="trail.jpg" alt="The trail through the forest" title="The trail through the forest">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The group size was such that it was possible to frequently change conversation
partners and our walking speed were well matched as well as ideal for
conversing during the hike.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The inspiring topics we touched upon ranged from AI (artificial intelligence)
safety, meaningful and meaningless questions after the death of a loved one,
ethical implications of Covid triage in hospitals, what &amp;ldquo;beliefs&amp;rdquo; are all the
way to to model aeroplanes and how to measure energy efficience and heat
dissipation in your home.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="landscape.jpg" alt="Overlooking forest and villages from the Teufelsmühle" title="Overlooking forest and villages from the Teufelsmühle">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>During the break at the Teufelsmühle, Marcus unpacked a camping cooker, a
manual coffee grinder as well as a few other accessories and real espresso
cups! While we enjoyed the excellent coffee we, of course, discussed our
confidence in actually being able to taste the difference vs. pretentious BS.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="group.jpg" alt="A few members of the group enjoying coffee" title="A few members of the
group enjoying coffee">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>After the hike was over, the evening tapered off with a piece of cake and a
round of coffee in one of the cafés in Bad Herrenalb. Is it good to give the
waiter the (polite) feedback that their coffee is really bad? What are the
consequences of doing so or not doing so? Even the simplest of questions must
be explored!&lt;/p>

by that? What I should mean is that in 8 out of 10 similar situations I would
be done by Friday and in 2 out of 10 I would not.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In reality people are frequently miscalibrated. When they say 80% it may in
fact turn out that only in 5 out of 10 similar projects they would be done by
the predicted date.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>When I ask you whether Brasil or China has a bigger landmass you might say
&amp;ldquo;China&amp;rdquo;. Then I ask &amp;ldquo;How certain are you?&amp;rdquo;. You might reply 80%.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>What do you mean by that? What you should mean is that given similar questions
you would get 8 out 10 right and 2 wrong.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Why is being miscalibrated bad? You might take a bet that you shouldn&amp;rsquo;t. You
might defend some position because you are not asking your own gut how sure you
&lt;em>really&lt;/em> are about that argument you are using.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Knowing yourself and assessing whether you can trust your intuitions or whether
you shouldn&amp;rsquo;t is a valuable skill.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The good news is that personal calibration can be trained really well. The bad
news is that it only transfers moderately well to other domains. So even if you
become very well calibrated for trivia questions you might not automatically
see an improvement in task estimation at work.&lt;/p>

to do many other things, we still managed to gather in the Stadtgarten for our
Rationality Freiburg meetup in the hope of an excellent discussion and
improvement at Rationality; we were not disappointed at all !!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We open our discussion with the blog-posts in the &lt;a href="https://www.readthesequences.com/Fake-Beliefs-Sequence">Fake Beliefs
sequence&lt;/a>, with some
snacks and sparkling water. As rationalists, we must ask ourselves about a
belief and what we expect to see to know whether the view holds the test or
not. A better way to do it would be what we do not wish to see or what
evidence would falsify the belief.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The sequence talks about &amp;lsquo;Belief in belief,&amp;rsquo; we can relate it to our lives in
many different scenarios, most notably religion. And it shows us a picture of
the exhausting tribalism we see in modern-day politics by introducing a
fascinating analogy such as Green vs. Blue.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Following the discussion, we played a game of double crux in pairs. It was a
captivating experience to discuss an issue where we disagree and then try to
identify the fundamental root cause of that disagreement. We collaborated to
to find that crux that makes us differ in opinion.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>As it is becoming customary and it is normal to feel hungry after two hours of
mental exercise, we went for some dinner in the city center in a Mexican
restaurant. Where our discussion on the double crux game continued, it is like
once you start peeling the layers, we were able to find that some parts of a
disagreement aren&amp;rsquo;t actually disagreements. In the end, we all agreed, with a
bit of practice, that it can be a very instrumental tool for resolving
conflicts.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Meetup July 8th 2022 - Sequences &amp; TAP Result Discussion</title><link>https://www.rationality-freiburg.de/events/meetup-2022-07-08-sequences-tap-result-discussion/</link><pubDate>Sat, 18 Jun 2022 17:37:02 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://www.rationality-freiburg.de/events/meetup-2022-07-08-sequences-tap-result-discussion/</guid><description>&lt;p>This event on

&lt;p>Afterwards we will &lt;strong>play a game of double crux&lt;/strong>. Double crux is an exercise
done in pairs where the goal is first to find an issue where you have a
disagreement and then identify the fundamental root cause of that disagreement.
It&amp;rsquo;s not about confrontation or discussing the issue, but &lt;strong>collaborating&lt;/strong> to
find that &lt;em>crux&lt;/em> that is making you disagree. For example two
people might disagree on wearing sandals with socks. After some collaborating
they find that the crux of their disagreement is how much importance they
assign to following tacit social norms. They could then dig even deeper why
these social norms are important or why they feel important. As preparation
you can think of a few &lt;em>controversial&lt;/em> beliefs you may have, so that it will be
quick to find a source of disagreement with your randomly assigned partner.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>There will be snacks and drinks.&lt;/p>

11 people thinking and discussing last Friday in the Freiburger Stadtgarten.
Half of us were newcomers, but all members came from Freiburg and its vicinity.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Soon after we gathered in the Stadtgarten, Omar opened up the discussion about
the first blog-posts in the &lt;a href="https://www.readthesequences.com/Predictably-Wrong-Sequence">Predictably Wrong
Sequence&lt;/a>. The
discussion branched out into many related topics, such as the role of
rationality in morality, its interplay with feelings and the rationality in
System 1 and 2 as defined by &lt;a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/11468377-thinking-fast-and-slow">Thinking Fast and
Slow&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Following the discussion, we took a calibration quiz in which answers are given
together with a subjective confidence, similar to &lt;a href="http://confidence.success-equation.com/">Confidence
Calibration&lt;/a>. The quiz helped us to
uncover and correct biases in our confidence.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>To round off the event, we went for some dinner in the city center and ended up
at the persian restaurant Shahaneh where discussions about rationality
continued on a more light-hearted note. As the sun went down, so did also the
quality of the discussed topics. Nevertheless, it was the perfect time and
place to discuss the latest news in the Heard vs Depp trial. Turns out rational
people also have guilty pleasures 😄️&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We are all looking forward to the next meeting, this time with you there as well!&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Afterwards we will &lt;strong>play a game of personal calibration&lt;/strong> i.e. a quiz where what is most important is to accurately assess how sure you are about your answer. For example: What is the third largest country of the world by area? China or Brazil? Are you 50%, 60%, 70%, 80%, 90% or 99% sure about your answer? Getting the answer wrong and saying you are only 50% sure (i.e. you are guessing!) is better than getting it wrong while being 70% certain.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Yesterday was the first meetup of the &lt;em>Rationality Freiburg&lt;/em> group and it was fantastic!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We were eight people in total, three of them newcomers who had found us via &lt;a href="https://www.meetup.com/rationality-freiburg/">meetup.com&lt;/a>. Also joining us were two rationalists from the &lt;em>&lt;a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/groups/kw7Zb8DLmZtsK8g3R">Karlsruhe Rationality&lt;/a>&lt;/em> community.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Meeting place was Schwabentor, Freiburg and everyone was very punctual. After an introduction round we walked up to the Kanonenplatz, enjoying the lovely weather.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Omar gave an overview of epistemic and instrumental rationality, as well as some common cognitive biases. Everyone got involved, giving examples, answering questions and reflecting on the topics.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="maps.jpg" alt="Maps help us move around the territory" title="Three maps on a table, one from Berlin, two from Freiburg with different resolutions">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;small>&lt;em>Maps help us move around the territory, but not all maps are equally good, just like a map from Berlin is useless to find your way around Freiburg. Epistemic rationality is about improving your map (mental model) of the territory (reality).&lt;/em>&lt;/small>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Once hunger started raising its head, the group checked several options in the city center. Since we preferred sitting outside and the streets were packed, it took us three attempts until we found a place. Being separated into two tables of four, we were forced to do some speed-dating-like switching mid dinner but this did not diminish our enjoyment.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Due to popular consensus the whole event took place in English.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We are all looking forward to the next meeting, this time with you there as well!&lt;/p>

&lt;p>This meetup is intended to invite newcomers and anyone who is curious to see what this is all about. Come, have a look and you may be surprised!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>There is no fixed agenda or structure other than talking and getting to know each other. If there is enough interest we will give an introduction to Bayesian thinking and how to apply it in your day-to-day life.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We will meet at 17:00 pm CEST (German time) at the Schwabentor in Freiburg and will walk up the Schloßberg to the Kanonenplatz and then decide where to go next.

&lt;p>Rationality Freiburg ist ein Treffpunkt für LessWrong- oder SSC-Leser sowie für andere an Rationalität (Rationality) interessierte Menschen. Rationality ist der Wunsch, die Welt so zu sehen, wie sie ist, insbesondere mit Hilfe der empirischen Wissenschaften sowie der Entwicklung von Werkzeugen zur Erreichung persönlicher Ziele.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Dieses Treffen soll Neulinge und alle Neugierigen einladen, die wissen wollen, worum es hier geht. Kommt einfach, schaut euch um und lasst euch überraschen!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Es gibt keine feste Tagesordnung, sondern die Möglichkeit, miteinander zu reden und sich kennen zu lernen. Wenn genügend Interesse besteht, werden wir eine Einführung in das Bayes&amp;rsquo;sche Denken geben und zeigen, wie man es im täglichen Leben anwenden kann.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Wir treffen uns um 17:00 Uhr MESZ am Schwabentor in Freiburg und werden den Schloßberg hinauf zum Kanonenplatz gehen und dann entscheiden, wohin wir weitergehen. Wir werden ein Schild dabeihaben auf dem &amp;ldquo;&lt;a href="https://www.rationality-freiburg.de">www.rationality-freiburg.de&lt;/a>&amp;rdquo; steht, damit ihr uns problemlos findet.&lt;/p>

It is about accepting the fallibility of human cognition and nevertheless striving to reach valuable conclusions. It&amp;rsquo;s applying empirical thinking to prove yourself wrong. It&amp;rsquo;s being humble and thirsty.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Rationality is not about being cold, unfeeling and robotic. It is not prioritizing abstract logic over human emotion. Rather it is accepting human emotion, both in oneself and others and understanding its beauty and purpose. If you are baffled by &lt;em>irrational&lt;/em> behaviour it&amp;rsquo;s actually you who is behaving &lt;em>irrationally&lt;/em> by expecting anything else.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Rationality is not supressing that warm glow you feel when hearing a beautiful piece of music. Rather it is bathing in that feeling. And maybe afterwards, if you are so inclined, reflecting in amazement how it is possible to produce such an effect.&lt;/p>

&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>I can&amp;rsquo;t understand how people could think science detracts from the beauty of the physical world.&lt;/p>

&lt;h2 id="faq---frequently-asked-questions">FAQ - Frequently Asked Questions&lt;/h2>
&lt;h3 id="what-is-rationality">What is Rationality?&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>The desire to see the world as it really is, not as you want it to be. This
means having an open mind, learning about human cognitive biases and how to
work around them as well as applying the scientific method (hypothesis +
experiment).&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="is-rationality-the-rejection-of-emotions-or-are-human-emotions-bad">Is Rationality the rejection of emotions or are human emotions bad?&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>No. Emotions and gut feelings are an integral part of the human experience and
in fact, vital for our survival. Seeing the world as it really is also implies
seeing humans as they really are. Emotions and intuitions work very well in
most situations, only in some cases they can mislead us. Recognizing those
cases and then improving the result of your decisions is useful.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="what-do-you-do">What do you do?&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>We have &lt;a href="https://www.rationality-freiburg.de/events/">meetups&lt;/a> every two weeks where we discuss
interesting topics and do exercises or play games that are fun and sometimes
teach us useful skills to better reach our personal goals. We also have a &lt;a href="https://www.rationality-freiburg.de/posts/book-club/">book
club&lt;/a> and a &lt;a href="https://www.rationality-freiburg.de/posts/statistics-study-group/">statistics study group&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="is-this-group-affiliated-with-a-political-party-or-entity">Is this group affiliated with a political party or entity?&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>No.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="is-this-group-a-cultsect">Is this group a cult/sect?&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>No. But remember that &lt;a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/yEjaj7PWacno5EvWa/every-cause-wants-to-be-a-cult">every cause wants to be a
cult&lt;/a>,
so we encourage you to always stay skeptical.&lt;/p>
