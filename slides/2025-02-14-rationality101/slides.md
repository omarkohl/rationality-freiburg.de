# Rationality 101
## Part 2

Feb 14th 2025

[www.rationality-freiburg.de](https://www.rationality-freiburg.de)

---

# What will you get?

* Reminder what **rationality** is:
  * epistemic rationality 
  * **Today's focus:** instrumental rationality
* What are good decisions?
* Expected value (EV) calculations
* The value of your time
* Discussion group "Stupidity: Our biggest threat?"
* (Maybe: Signal Detection Theory)

---

# So ... what is rationality?

* Write down your answers
* No fancy definitions, just your own words
* What is _epistemic_ rationality?
* What is _instrumental_ rationality?
* Let's compare

---

# Rationality: Definition 1

<div class="columns">
<div>

The study of **judgement** and **decision making** under _uncertainty_.

</div>
<div>

* **Judgement:** What should I believe? â†’ epistemic
* **decision making**: What should I do? â†’ instrumental
* _uncertainty_: I don't have all the information. The world is complicated.

</div>
</div>

---

# Rationality: Definition 2

<div class="columns">
<div>

The art of thinking in ways that result in **true beliefs** and **good decisions**.

</div>
<div>

* **true beliefs:** What should I believe? â†’ epistemic
* **good decisions**: What should I do? â†’ instrumental

</div>
</div>

---

# True Belief

* Correlates with reality
* High(er) explanatory power (past)
  * Germ theory vs. miasma theory.
* High(er) predictive power (future)
  * Judging traffic to cross safely.
* ... relative to some other belief
* _True(er) belief_

---

# Decisions

* Think of any bad decision you made in the last 12 months. Big or small. You don't have to share.
* Think of any good decision you made in the last 12 months.

---

# Good decisions?

* Emily spent half her paycheck on lottery tickets. She won a million dollars.
* Javier invested in a diversified index fund. Five years later, his savings had doubled.
* Aisha followed her doctor's advice and got the flu vaccine. A rare side effect caused her to feel sick for weeks.
* Tom decided to drive home drunk. He got pulled over and lost his license.

---

# What IS a good decision?

* What is the purpose of **classifying** into good and bad decision?
* Frequently we judge only based on the **outcome**. Good outcome, good decision. Bad outcome, bad decision.
  * Regret for regret's sake is **pointless**.
  * (Feeling joy for joy's sake about a past decision _may_ be good.)
* The only reason for classifying: Making better decision in the **future**.
* **Good decision:** Given my constraints at the time it had a better **EV** than the alternatives.

---

# Expected Value (EV)

* (_Erwartungswert_ in German)
* We use it intuitively all the time
* ... but we also frequently ignore it

---

# The Taxi Dilemma

You're in a foreign city for an important meeting. It's rush hour, and you need to get to your destination **as quickly as possible**.  

There are two taxis available:  

- One is a **shiny new sedan**, driven by a well-dressed driver who looks calm and professional.  
- The other is an **older, slightly dented car**, with a driver who seems restless, tapping the steering wheel impatiently.  

You really canâ€™t afford to be late. **Which taxi do you take? Why?**  

---

# Bet

<div class="columns">
<div>

![width:400px Die](dice-1294902_640.png)

</div>
<div>

* If a **six** comes up I give you 100â‚¬
* Any **other number**, you give me 1â‚¬
* Do you take the bet?

* Let's say we played three rounds. Numbers were five, two, two. **You lost 3â‚¬**. Was it a **mistake** to play?

</div>
</div>

---

# EV

The average outcome youâ€™d get if you made the same decision many times.

It combines the possible results with how likely they are, helping you choose the option that leads to the best long-term gainsâ€”even if a single outcome might be unlucky.

Calculation: Multiply each outcome's value by its probability; then add everything up.

---

# EV Calculation

$$  
EV = \sum P(x_i) \cdot x_i  
$$  

- Chance of rolling a **six**: 1/6, payout = **100â‚¬**  
- Chance of rolling **one to five**: 5/6, payout = **-1â‚¬**  

$$  
EV = \left(\frac{1}{6} \times 100\right) + \left(\frac{5}{6} \times (-1)\right)  
$$  

$$
EV = \frac{100}{6} - \frac{5}{6} = \frac{95}{6} \approx \text{16â‚¬}
$$

# Exercise: Backup

* Personal PC/laptop with your data
  * Combine multiple devices into one
* Do you have a backup?
  * If yes, imagine you don't.
* Visualize total data loss
  * How much would you pay for recovery? Write it down.

---

# Exercise: Backup 2

* Imagine 1,000 people in very similar life circumstances as you currently.
* How many of them will suffer a total data loss within the next 3 years? Your best guess. (hardware crash, water damage, laptop lost, ...)
* Convert that to a probability and write it down:
  * e.g. 500 people = 500 / 1000 = 50%
  * e.g. 1 person = 1 / 1000 = 0.1%
* This is your probability of data loss within the next 3 years.

---

# Exercise: Backup 3

* What would be the monetary costs for a backup?
  * External hard disk(s) (e.g. 100â‚¬)
  * Cloud service (e.g. 10â‚¬/month)
  * Backup software (e.g. 50â‚¬/year)
* How much do you dislike taking care of this, shopping, configuring etc.?
  * How much would you pay someone else to do it for you?
* Add it all up for total 3 year costs.

---

# Exercise: Backup 4

* EV of setting up a backup: ...
* EV of NOT setting up a backup: ...
* So ... what does this mean?
* Did the result surprise you? (it surprised me!)
* Use it as additional input for your decision. Explicit EV calculations are a tool to **help** making decisions.
* Don't let a spreadsheet tell you what to do with your life ðŸ˜‰

# What is a good decision?

* One that given the constraints at the time had higher EV than other options.
* One that I would repeat in the future.

---

# What is expected value?

* The average outcome youâ€™d get if you made the same decision many times.

---

# Can you calculate the EV?

* You get 2â‚¬ if a fair coin comes up heads and you pay 1â‚¬ otherwise.
* EV = 0.5â‚¬ = 50 cent

---

# Why is it valuable to know the monetary value of your time?

* Because we frequently trade time for money (e.g not taking a cab, queuing for a free item) and it's useful to make this tradeoff consciously.
