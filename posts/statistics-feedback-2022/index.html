Here is just a
list of things people have said, without any context. Is this useful? Possibly
not, but it might give a general impression whether people enjoy coming (they
do!). It was also noted a few times that negative feedback actually lead to
changes, which was appreciated by participants. If after a feedback it says 3x
it means 3 people reported the same.</p><p>The discussion went off rails at times. The discussion group was too big.
(Solution: Split the group) 3x</p><p>Having such a discussion in English is hard. (Solution: Split the group into
German and English)</p><p>Having a public feedback round is not so great (Solution: Distribute paper for
written feedback)</p><p>Doing something hand on was very nice.</p><p>The meeting place was great (Stadtgarten).</p><p>I liked the playful character of the calibration game.</p><p>We should keep some instrumental rationality in every meetup.</p><p>Very well prepared, with Snacks etc.</p><p>Discussions need to start off a common ground. People may have very different
knowledge. Today it was good.</p><p>A lot of fun.</p><p>Good balance of moderation/leading the discussion and letting people discuss by
Omar.</p><p>There was little time to do the Double Crux,</p><p>People came a little late, which initially left me fearing that nobody would
come.</p><p>Double Crux does not work well with 3 persons.</p><p>Everyone felt that it was a useful technique and that we should do it again in
the future.</p><p>The group size was ideal.</p><p>Practical exercises very good.</p><p>We did not discuss one of the posts that we wanted to and instead went off
topic. We should try to stick to our plan.</p><p>I liked your and X’s contributions a lot and most other people were good
too. One person was terrible and I don’t know how to manage people like that, I
think you did your best. I liked everyone else. The structure was pretty good
and your moderating was pretty good, I’d just echo what other people said about
time allocation.</p><p>Overton Gymnastics is a good exercise!</p><p>Very interesting to see a meetup with people who are all quite new to
rationality!</p><p>The game [exercise] was not well explained at all!!</p><p>I found the Sequences posts rather boring / not super interesting.</p><p>I&rsquo;m not sure if having newbies to rationality in the group is a good idea.</p><p>Maybe more moderation?</p><p>Great seeing all of you again!</p><p>Happy to again exchange thoughts with all of you.</p><p>The discussion round dynamic was not ideal this time.</p><p>Not enough air circulation [because of COVID]</p><p>We should allocate fixed time slots to every post [to avoid the discussion
getting too deep into other subjects]</p><p>The group was too large [10 people] for one discussion round.</p><p>Discussing three posts [as we did] and not more is ideal.</p><p>We should have split into two groups of five people.</p><p>There was not enough time for the exercise. The discussion should only take up
half the time.</p><p>Please arrive 5 minutes before the start to avoid the entire session starting
15 minutes late.</p><p>5 people group size is good. +1</p><p>Prediction game. Manifold Markets. The chosen questions. All very nice.</p><p>Well organized.</p><p>Interesting experience. I will come back. I was irritated by the music (coming
in through the windows from the street). The UI from Manifold Markets is
confusing and I won&rsquo;t be using it. 2 hours was too short for the event.</p><p>I was missing a little more &ldquo;instrumental rationality&rdquo; e.g. TAPs</p><p>Giving a short summary of every text is a good custom that we should keep up
(we did not do it this time) for people who have not read the texts. One person
is responsible.</p><p>The goal of the meetup was unclear beforehand. I was unaware it was so formal.
It would have been better to arrive on time. If you host such a structured
meetup it would be better to go all the way and make it even more formal.
Having conversations about (ACX) posts would happen naturally during dinner
anyway.</p><p>I really liked the meetup.</p><p>The exercise was weird.</p><p>I really liked the summaries of the ACX posts.</p><p>Thank you for organizing this. I appreciate very much how serious you take
feedback and how attentive you are as a organizer by adapting the meetup
according to it. There is however a risk that catering too much to the
participants could lead to stagnation of the group. Nevertheless, trying to
keep things in flux (for better or worse) is a great quality for an organizer
and is better than sticking only with one formula.</p><p>It was my first time in the group. I think it is very unusual to find people
who try to do such exercises to improve themselves. The exercise (falling
drill) was not very effective because it was clear that it was only a
simulation.</p><p>During the exercise (falling drill) I was in fact wrong about something where
in fact I thought I would be right. That was unexpected, but it was very easy
for me to admit this and that is unusual. Usually it&rsquo;s hard for me to admit a
mistake, but I felt comfortable doing it in this group.</p><p>During the first part of the meetup it would have been better to go deeper into
one or two ACX posts instead of briefly presenting one per person.</p><p>I will return!</p><p>It was my first time and the first round (discussing ACX posts) was great! It
gave me new things to consider that I had never thought about. Concerning the
game (falling drill) I already train being able to be wrong a lot so I probably
fail more often in the opposite direction (being too unsure), so it wasn&rsquo;t very
effective for me.</p><p>The setting was too artificial for the game (falling drill).</p><p>I really appreciate your (organizer&rsquo;s) work. We should have spent more time on
the first round (discussing ACX posts). It was too short.</p><p>Forming two groups of 5-6 people was great! The perfect size. In bigger groups
people get lost.</p><p>It was a very nice way of spending the evening.</p><p>I am blown away by the effort you invested in preparing this.</p><p>The accoustics of the room were annoying.</p><p>The group size was ideal.</p><p>The exercise (falling drill) would work better if you had to give confidence
intervals and could be criticized for choosing those badly.</p><p>Best: Hike on the next day</p><p>Best: Getting to know new people and discussing our favourite posts from the
ACX/SSC blogs.</p><p>Best: Discussing our favourite articles by Scott , and also the hike on the day
after.</p><p>Best: The sheer number of new, astonishing insights</p><p>Best: Level of conversation was high.</p><p>Best: Improving my ability to say out loud when I&rsquo;m wrong, without feeling bad
about it.</p><p>Worst: The room</p><p>Worst: Felt a tiny(!) bit cultish</p><p>Worst: Disturbing political opinions</p><p>Worst: The location was uninspiring.</p><p>Worst: The room had bad accoustics</p><p>I don’t like going to restaurants that much, it’s much more expensive than what
I usually spend on food</p><p>Less structured meetings or a way to branch ideas into spin-off collaborations
in a structured context might make me more excited to come.</p><p>Omar is cool. He’s a little obsessed with perfection. He needs to loosen up a
bit. These things take time to grow.</p><p>Interesting concepts shared. Rationality is certainly a toolkit that can be
applied in everything and can benefit many people and a lot of lives. But it’s
not universally seen as a good because it’s a competitor to many classic
frameworks like organized religion. So developing a model that competes on the
same playing field is tough.</p><p>The exercise (Hamming circle) was probably helpful for an issue I have been
thinking about for several years</p><p>I was not so happy that only four people came</p><p>What you [the organizer] are doing here is really valuable</p><p>I enjoyed the exercise [Hamming circle]. It made me make up my mind.</p><p>We should keep the exercise part of the meetup.</p><p>I really enjoyed it.</p><p>I liked the Hamming circle very much. Especially having to turn around while
the advisors were discussing, something which I had anticipated I wouldn&rsquo;t
like.</p><p>The discussion round about &ldquo;Trusting experts&rdquo; didn&rsquo;t get to the core of the
issue. It would have required drawing on the whiteboard and a couple of hours
of time.</p><p>Acoustics of the room were great.</p><p>TAPs was interesting.</p><p>Getting to know cool people.</p><p>I didn&rsquo;t get Occam&rsquo;s razor.</p><p>Lack of structure and bad time allocation.</p><p>Valuable meeting.</p><p>I liked the mix of discussions and practical things.</p><p>I liked both parts.</p><p>Very nice joint event [with EA Freiburg].</p><p>I learnt something (x2)</p><p>Nice mix of input and exercises.</p><p>I am glad it was so interactive.</p><p>Interesting. It took longer than expected to get into the subject (long
introduction). I liked it.</p><p>I liked the refreshed (on probability theory). Took too long to get started. It
would have been better to define some terms and present a clear agenda for the
evening upfront.</p><p>I liked it. It was a good refresher. I was missing a little the &ldquo;how to apply
it&rdquo; part.</p><p>Good mix of presentation and exercises. Good refresher.</p><p>Fun and interesting.</p><p>The content of the talk has good applicability to life.</p><p>Considering the prior probability of events before evaluating the evidence was
something I had not thought about before.</p><p>I have a better understanding of Bayes&rsquo; theorem now.</p><p>Timing was not optimal. It would have been better to have more time to think
about a strategy for the Poker game.</p><p>I realized that I do not think enough about priors.</p><p>You should have focused a little bit more about why our intuition fails us and
how to come to a better intuitive grasp of these concepts.</p><p>It opened new perspectives.</p><p>The talk was well prepared.</p></div></article></main><footer class="footer layout__footer"><p><span>© Rationality Freiburg</span></p><p><a href=mailto:info@rationality-freiburg.de>info@rationality-freiburg.de</a></p></footer></div></body></html>
