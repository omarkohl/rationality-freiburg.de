Here is just a
list of things people have said, without any context. Is this useful? Possibly
not, but it might give a general impression whether people enjoy coming (they
do!). It was also noted a few times that negative feedback actually lead to
changes, which was appreciated by participants. If after a feedback it says x3
it means 3 people reported the same.</p><ul><li><p>The discussion went off rails at times. The discussion group was too big.
[Solution: Split the group] x3</p></li><li><p>Having such a discussion in English is hard. [Solution: Split the group into
German and English]</p></li><li><p>Having a public feedback round is not so great. [Solution: Distribute paper
for written feedback]</p></li><li><p>Doing something hands-on was very nice.</p></li><li><p>The meeting place was great [Stadtgarten].</p></li><li><p>I liked the playful character of the calibration game.</p></li><li><p>We should keep some instrumental rationality in every meetup.</p></li><li><p>Very well prepared, with Snacks etc.</p></li><li><p>Discussions need to start off a common ground. People may have very different
knowledge. Today it was good.</p></li><li><p>A lot of fun.</p></li><li><p>Good balance of moderation/leading the discussion and letting people discuss
by Omar.</p></li><li><p>There was little time to do the Double Crux.</p></li><li><p>People came a little late, which initially left me fearing that nobody would
come.</p></li><li><p>Double Crux does not work well with 3 persons.</p></li><li><p>Everyone felt that it was a useful technique and that we should do it again
in the future.</p></li><li><p>The group size was ideal.</p></li><li><p>Practical exercises were very good.</p></li><li><p>We did not discuss one of the posts that we wanted to and instead went off
topic. We should try to stick to our plan.</p></li><li><p>I liked your and X’s contributions a lot and most other people were good too.
One person was terrible and I don’t know how to manage people like that, I
think you did your best. I liked everyone else. The structure was pretty good
and your moderating was pretty good, I’d just echo what other people said
about time allocation.</p></li><li><p>Overton Gymnastics is a good exercise!</p></li><li><p>Very interesting to see a meetup with people who are all quite new to
rationality!</p></li><li><p>The game [exercise] was not well explained at all!!</p></li><li><p>I found the Sequences posts rather boring / not super interesting.</p></li><li><p>I&rsquo;m not sure if having newbies to rationality in the group is a good idea.</p></li><li><p>Maybe more moderation?</p></li><li><p>Great seeing all of you again!</p></li><li><p>Happy to again exchange thoughts with all of you.</p></li><li><p>The dynamic of the discussion round was not ideal this time.</p></li><li><p>Not enough air circulation [because of COVID].</p></li><li><p>We should allocate fixed time slots to every post [to avoid the discussion
getting too deep into other subjects].</p></li><li><p>The group was too large [10 people] for one discussion round.</p></li><li><p>Discussing three posts [as we did] and not more is ideal.</p></li><li><p>We should have split into two groups of five people.</p></li><li><p>There was not enough time for the exercise. The discussion should only take
up half the time.</p></li><li><p>Please arrive 5 minutes before the start to avoid the entire session starting
15 minutes late.</p></li><li><p>5 people group size is good. x2</p></li><li><p>Prediction game. Manifold Markets. The chosen questions. All very nice.</p></li><li><p>Well organized.</p></li><li><p>Interesting experience. I will come back. I was irritated by the music
[coming in through the windows from the street]. The UI from Manifold Markets
is confusing and I won&rsquo;t be using it. 2 hours was too short for the event.</p></li><li><p>I was missing a little more &ldquo;instrumental rationality&rdquo; e.g. TAPs.</p></li><li><p>Giving a short summary of every text is a good custom that we should keep up
[we did not do it this time] for people who have not read the texts. One
person is responsible.</p></li><li><p>The goal of the meetup was unclear beforehand. I was unaware it was so
formal. It would have been better to arrive on time. If you host such a
structured meetup it would be better to go all the way and make it even more
formal. Having conversations about [ACX] posts would happen naturally during
dinner anyway.</p></li><li><p>I really liked the meetup.</p></li><li><p>The exercise was weird.</p></li><li><p>I really liked the summaries of the ACX posts.</p></li><li><p>Thank you for organizing this. I appreciate very much how serious you take
feedback and how attentive you are as a organizer by adapting the meetup
according to it. There is however a risk that catering too much to the
participants could lead to stagnation of the group. Nevertheless, trying to
keep things in flux (for better or worse) is a great quality for an organizer
and is better than sticking only with one formula.</p></li><li><p>It was my first time in the group. I think it is very unusual to find people
who try to do such exercises to improve themselves. The exercise [falling
drill] was not very effective because it was clear that it was only a
simulation.</p></li><li><p>During the exercise [falling drill] I was in fact wrong about something where
in fact I thought I would be right. That was unexpected, but it was very easy
for me to admit this and that is unusual. Usually it&rsquo;s hard for me to admit a
mistake, but I felt comfortable doing it in this group.</p></li><li><p>During the first part of the meetup it would have been better to go deeper
into one or two ACX posts instead of briefly presenting one per person.</p></li><li><p>I will return!</p></li><li><p>It was my first time and the first round [discussing ACX posts] was great! It
gave me new things to consider that I had never thought about. Concerning the
game [falling drill] I already train being able to be wrong a lot so I
probably fail more often in the opposite direction [being too unsure], so it
wasn&rsquo;t very effective for me.</p></li><li><p>The setting was too artificial for the game [falling drill].</p></li><li><p>I really appreciate your [organizer&rsquo;s] work. We should have spent more time
on the first round [discussing ACX posts]. It was too short.</p></li><li><p>Forming two groups of 5-6 people was great! The perfect size. In bigger
groups people get lost.</p></li><li><p>It was a very nice way of spending the evening.</p></li><li><p>I am blown away by the effort you invested in preparing this.</p></li><li><p>The accoustics of the room were annoying.</p></li><li><p>The group size was ideal.</p></li><li><p>The exercise [falling drill] would work better if you had to give confidence
intervals and could be criticized for choosing those badly.</p></li><li><p>Best: Hike on the next day.</p></li><li><p>Best: Getting to know new people and discussing our favourite posts from the
ACX/SSC blogs.</p></li><li><p>Best: Discussing our favourite articles by Scott, and also the hike on the
day after.</p></li><li><p>Best: The sheer number of new, astonishing insights.</p></li><li><p>Best: Level of conversation was high.</p></li><li><p>Best: Improving my ability to say out loud when I&rsquo;m wrong, without feeling
bad about it.</p></li><li><p>Worst: The room.</p></li><li><p>Worst: Felt a tiny(!) bit cultish.</p></li><li><p>Worst: Disturbing political opinions.</p></li><li><p>Worst: The location was uninspiring.</p></li><li><p>Worst: The room had bad accoustics.</p></li><li><p>I don’t like going to restaurants that much, it’s much more expensive than
what I usually spend on food.</p></li><li><p>Less structured meetings or a way to branch ideas into spin-off
collaborations in a structured context might make me more excited to come.</p></li><li><p>Omar is cool. He’s a little obsessed with perfection. He needs to loosen up a
bit. These things take time to grow.</p></li><li><p>Interesting concepts shared. Rationality is certainly a toolkit that can be
applied in everything and can benefit many people and a lot of lives. But
it’s not universally seen as a good because it’s a competitor to many classic
frameworks like organized religion. So developing a model that competes on
the same playing field is tough.</p></li><li><p>The exercise [Hamming circle] was probably helpful for an issue I have been
thinking about for several years.</p></li><li><p>I was not so happy that only four people came.</p></li><li><p>What you [the organizer] are doing here is really valuable.</p></li><li><p>I enjoyed the exercise [Hamming circle]. It made me make up my mind.</p></li><li><p>We should keep the exercise part of the meetup.</p></li><li><p>I really enjoyed it.</p></li><li><p>I liked the Hamming circle very much. Especially having to turn around while
the advisors were discussing, something which I had anticipated I wouldn&rsquo;t
like.</p></li><li><p>The discussion round about &ldquo;Trusting experts&rdquo; didn&rsquo;t get to the core of the
issue. It would have required drawing on the whiteboard and a couple of hours
of time.</p></li><li><p>Acoustics of the room were great.</p></li><li><p>TAPs was interesting.</p></li><li><p>Getting to know cool people.</p></li><li><p>I didn&rsquo;t get Occam&rsquo;s razor.</p></li><li><p>Lack of structure and bad time allocation.</p></li><li><p>Valuable meeting.</p></li><li><p>I liked the mix of discussions and practical things.</p></li><li><p>I liked both parts.</p></li><li><p>Very nice joint event [with EA Freiburg].</p></li><li><p>I learnt something. x2</p></li><li><p>Nice mix of input and exercises.</p></li><li><p>I am glad it was so interactive.</p></li><li><p>Interesting. It took longer than expected to get into the subject [long
introduction]. I liked it.</p></li><li><p>I liked the refreshed [on probability theory]. Took too long to get started.
It would have been better to define some terms and present a clear agenda for
the evening upfront.</p></li><li><p>I liked it. It was a good refresher. I was missing a little the &ldquo;how to apply
it&rdquo; part.</p></li><li><p>Good mix of presentation and exercises. Good refresher.</p></li><li><p>Fun and interesting.</p></li><li><p>The content of the talk has good applicability to life.</p></li><li><p>Considering the prior probability of events before evaluating the evidence
