(Updated: February 22, 2024)</header><div class=content><p><strong>UPDATE 2023-01-23:</strong> This post was a proposal, but it has not been
implemented and will not be implemented in this form! There are currently no
meetup rules. The reasons for this is that several people were unhappy about
the proposal and there was a general fear that these rules would be offputting
for new people. Nonetheless, punctuality and preparation are much appreciated.</p><p>What is the purpose of our meetups? Surprisingly, not an easy question to
answer. For me, it is having a place and time where I am challenged, surprised
and intellectually stimulated. Where I feel safe to share a part of myself.
Where I can learn and grow.</p><p>This is what I want for myself and what I want to provide for you, the guests,
the participants.</p><p>A gathering is a social contract, even though we frequently resist thinking in
such transactional terms because it seems cold. The organizer gives you
something, or at least promises to, and the participant gives something in
return. Frequently their time and energy, sometimes their money.</p><p>The organizer has the privilege and burden of ensuring that the gathering
fulfills its purpose and that every participant gets what they were promised.</p><p>Sometimes this is in conflict with what a particular participant wants in a
particular moment.</p><p>For example, if a meetup has started and a round of introduction is through,
everyone has shared a small piece of themselves. An atmosphere of trust and
commitment has been created. And, suddenly, one new person arrives. This new
person will have missed all this introduction, and will therefore, gain less
from the gathering than the others. But, even more, they are also taking away
something from the other participants. There is a small disruption to the
atmosphere that had been created. People don&rsquo;t know this new person. Or even if
they do, they can&rsquo;t sense what mood they bring. The relaxation, the leaving
behind of the world outside, is threatened. So, everyone loses a little bit.
All of this just to benefit the person who came late. They will get 70% of the
benefit of the gathering, at the cost of making it a little bit worse for
everyone else.</p><p>The same thing is true if there was an agreement to prepare in some way for the
event. If everyone except one person prepares, then that one person will get
all the benefit of all the work the other people invested, but they themselves
will give nothing in return. It is an unfair trade.</p><p>The duty of the organizer is to preserve the atmosphere, the purpose and the
fairness of the gathering. This is an intuition I have had for a long time.
Reading Priya Parker&rsquo;s &ldquo;The Art of Gathering&rdquo; made me confident enough to
express and demand it.</p><p>I therefore, propose the following rules for our gatherings. I request and want
feedback on and criticism of this proposal, but I won&rsquo;t easily be swayed
because I care, very strongly, about these meetups and their purpose.</p><p>After having expressed some of my thoughts during the last meetup, I already
got feedback from multiple people. I am very grateful for that! That feedback
has helped shape what follows.</p><h1 id=rules-punctuality--preparation>Rules (Punctuality & Preparation)</h1><ol><li>The rules do not apply to people who come for the first time, because they
can&rsquo;t be expected to know them.</li><li>The first 15 minutes of the meetup will be considered arrival time for
informal chatting, snacking and setting up. You may arrive at any time
within those 15 minutes. In order to accomodate this, the meetup duration
will be extended from 2 to 2.5 hours.</li><li>If you arrive 16 minutes or more after the announced start time, you will be
considered <em>latecomer</em>.</li><li>If you do not prepare for the meetup in the way described in the invitation,
you will be considered <em>unprepared</em>. This is only based on your own word. If
you say you have prepared, that is good enough, no further proof is required.</li><li>If you are <em>latecomer</em> or <em>unprepared</em> you must make a one-time donation to
a charity of your choice.</li><li>The amount you must donate is 1% of your monthly income or 1% of your
monthly expenses, whichever is higher. This is only based on your own word.
For example, if on average you earn 2100 € per month and spend 2300 € per
month, you must donate 23 €. You do not need to report any of your finances
to anyone. Calculating the correct amount is entirely up to you.</li><li>If you already donate money to a charity anyway, that does not count. This
donation must be in addition to other donations.</li><li>If you are both <em>latecomer</em> and <em>unprepared</em>, you must donate double the
amount.</li><li>You must provide proof of donation (scan, photograph, printscreen) before
you can join a future meetup. If you do not, you will be asked to leave. You
may obfuscate whatever personal information you deem necessary on the proof
of donation, including the amount of the donation.</li><li>You will sign these rules in order to symbolize that you accept them. If
you do not, you will be asked to leave.</li></ol><p>If the amount of preparation required for a meetup is too much or the reading
uninteresting, please give early feedback, so it can be considered. It is
perfectly acceptable to have meetups without any required preparation. We want
to have gatherings that are useful and stimulating, not make you do tedious or
useless work.</p><p>The goal of these rules is very clear: Ensure people come on time and well
prepared. If this goal is not reached, then the rules will be adapted e.g. by
increasing the donation amount.</p></div></article></main><footer class="footer layout__footer mt--l"><p><span>© Rationality Freiburg</span></p><p><a href=mailto:info@rationality-freiburg.de>info@rationality-freiburg.de</a></p></footer></div></body></html>
