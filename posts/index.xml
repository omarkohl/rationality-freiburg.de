&lt;p>a little more time for group discussion would have been nice (also at least one swapping of people in the smaller group)&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Micro-optimization: Instead of suggesting updating the estimates for every slide it might have been better to have 4 checkpoints during the presentation where participants were explicitly asked &amp;ldquo;now revise your estimates, if you want to, you have 2 minutes&amp;rdquo;. It would also have given more space on the page to write.&lt;/p>

averaging over 18 people per meetup. This is fantastic since we love having new
people! On average there are 2 newcomers at every meetup.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>At the same time us, the people who have been coming to these meetups on a
regular basis for a year or more, feel that sometimes they are becoming too big
too fast and that we will not be able to retain the level of comfort and trust
that we cherish.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>For this reason we have decided to start having closed meetups that are not
open to newcomers. &lt;strong>Anyone&lt;/strong> who has been to a &lt;strong>previous meetup&lt;/strong> is welcome
to join these closed meetups! The &lt;strong>normal meetups&lt;/strong>, where we welcome &lt;strong>new
people&lt;/strong> with open arms, &lt;strong>will keep happening nonetheless!&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>How can you tell the difference? &lt;strong>Closed meetups will not be announced
online.&lt;/strong> So, if you find an event on this website or meetup.com, please come
whether you are new or not!&lt;/p>

&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>I liked the „make the elephants like each other idea“&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Preconditions to ensure before using the method would be interesting to formalise. A list of common typical cruxes would be nice&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Friendly&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>The discussion in the smaller group (though the group was still somewhat big)&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>The exercise of fooling an outsider was great! [An older version of the feedback form had only one answer field for &amp;ldquo;best&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;worst&amp;rdquo;. An organizer split that comment, making the best guess what the commenter was trying to say.]&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Small discussion group&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>people&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>The many views brought about by the different participants. The reading list.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Die Übung&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>the structure with 3 levels of preparation was very good idea&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Was fun&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>die Stimmung + entspannte Atmosphäre&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>das Spielen hat sehr viel Spaß gemacht&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Was fun&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Viele neue Leute + Spiele kennengelernt&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Was fun to be introduced to new games.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Cool games&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>[The game] Karriere Poker&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Got to play Scrabble&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Mich mal wieder ein bisschen an die Karriere-Poker Strategie erinnern. War leider zu kurz, um komplett rein zu kommen.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>New room was great!&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Es gab eine sehr gute Balance zwischen Diskussion, Input und Übungen.&lt;br>
Die Triviafragen waren eine gute Idee, aber auch etwas stressig 😄&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Texts [An older version of the feedback form had only one answer field for &amp;ldquo;best&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;worst&amp;rdquo;. An organizer split that comment, making the best guess what the commenter was trying to say.]&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>New room is nice!&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Der große Raum war gut (wenn auch etwas kalt).&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>discussions&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Der Raum war schön groß.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>I enjoyed the big group discussion about procrastination.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Discussion was great. [An older version of the feedback form had only one answer field for &amp;ldquo;best&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;worst&amp;rdquo;. An organizer split that comment, making the best guess what the commenter was trying to say.]&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Topic&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Room 10/10&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We have space for some movement exercises there maybe. Like arranging in order of attribute of person for introduction [Typo corrected]&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>discussions + exercise&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>topic&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Many interesting impulses.&lt;br>
Great atmosphere of discussions.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>the topic in general!&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Mind blown&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Some very interesting ideas popped up during presentation and discussion. [An older version of the feedback form had only one answer field for &amp;ldquo;best&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;worst&amp;rdquo;. An organizer split that comment, making the best guess what the commenter was trying to say.]&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>The topic, the progression.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Gute Präsentationen, angenehme Stimmung.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Open discussion.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Zivilisierte Diskussion in grosser Runde&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>the small group discussion (was too little time though)&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Very interesting presentations focusing on two different aspects/approaches to the question of consciousness.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>The presentations and the discussions were really interesting and fun.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Presentation is rich in content. [An older version of the feedback form had only one answer field for &amp;ldquo;best&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;worst&amp;rdquo;. An organizer split that comment, making the best guess what the commenter was trying to say.]&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Digging really deep into seemingly simple problems with other people was very enjoyable.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Loved the structuring and that the number of exercises was not too high.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Super interesting content.&lt;br>
Discovered many flaws in my thinking.&lt;br>
Physics is cool!&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>The discussions with other people who I hadn&amp;rsquo;t met before. The mindbogliness of the questions.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Very intersting topic. I liked to discover the flaws in my reasoning and thinking strategies.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Demonstrated my lack of intuitive, on-hand knowledge of physics and also that given enough time and effort, can understand (most of) it, even from just thinking and mulling over the problem&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Problems&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Working in smaller groups depending on our level&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>The book I got to know. :-)&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Diskussion&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Die Rätsel&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Noticing my own confusion&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Zu erkennen, dass eine gefühlte 80%ige Sicherheit leicht wieder kippen kann, wenn man länger nachdenkt.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Most - topics&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Everyone had read some of the material so it was possible to have informed discussions.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Snacks, some people&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Zahlen bringen was, wenn man weiss, dass sie falsch sind&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Die Aussicht.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>vibes, the route, nature, discussions&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Most- everyone was inclusive and kind. Other things- hike location, organisation with the public transport&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Getting to know some people&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Fantastic weather, beautiful route and many interesting conversations.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Good training impulse 😃&lt;br>
Group was relaxed, everyone seemed to enjoy the speed&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Walking together, talking to each other&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Für mich haben Uhrzeit, Dauer und Niveau der Wanderung perfekt gepasst.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Free seach&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Die Diskussionen.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>small group discussion&lt;br>
thought experiments&lt;br>
snacks&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Good structure, clear definitions and questions.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>The intro&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>The sofa&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Talking about new things, ideas&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Gruppendiskussionen&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>The variety of discussion topics&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Very diverse topics, enlightening discussion&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Diskussionen im Allgemeinen und ihre Struktur (2 Minuten für These, 20 Minuten Gruppendiskussion)&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Escalator came before escalate&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Diskussion über Autokratien.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Condensing a topic to a short discussion worked well and made it very interesting.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Ich durfte 2 minuten am Stück reden&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Örtlichkeit ist sehr schön, Menschen sind super nett und impulse waren cool&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Being actively involved (through the opportunity of bringing a topic)&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Small group discussion&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>The atmosphere of a lot of people getting a lot of stuff done at the same time. :-)&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Small round, we all knew each other so it felt quite relaxing.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Practical Exercise&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>The chocolate was quite tasty.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>People ❤️&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>How hard and yet possibly useful SE is. Also the video was good. The exercise with climate change belief was great as it was directionally aligned with my bias and so was hard and made me think.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Interesting topic&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>The discussion&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Practical part&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Learned a lot, good info and experiences on ETFs.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Interesting topic with practical application. Useful to hear experiences from different people.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Knowledge gain was noticeable.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>The interactive discussion all throughout&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>SE kinda worked once [fixed grammar]&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Coole Methode!&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Interviews und vorbereitete Fragen&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Challenging questions.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>People&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Exchanging the strategies, interaktive Ansatz&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Systematic approach to thinking. Thanks so much!&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Thinking logically&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Deconstruction of problems&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Focusing on the essential&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Das Nachdenken und diskutieren&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Physics questions&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Speculatius&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Discussing &amp;amp; explaining&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>People&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Invest in children&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>The vibes. Feeling welcome and included despite me being shy.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Vibe&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Secret hitler&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Fun new games&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Was great fun!&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Visit by other rationality group member(s)&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Accusing Omar of being a fascist&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Was surprised by the advances&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Moderator Humor&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Extraordinarily well structure and compact overview of currently available GenAI tools/plattforms/services that are worth trying. [Typo fixed]&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>It was fun!&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Got a very good overview on AI tools.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Interactivity&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>The story of Cicero&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>The game&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>combination of input, play and discussion, vibe&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Playing Diplomacy&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Playing together was quite fun&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>topic + discussions&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Atmosphere, learning my death chance&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Open topic, great for discussion.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Working questions, nice discussion groups, the topic&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Very interesting topic, nice discussions rounds&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>The couch and the smiles&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Most participants knew each other and I had the impression that the topic itself plus the joking about it made us connect as a group even further.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Sharing our ritual ideas&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Cogito, ergo sum&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Interesting insights&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Openess&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Humour, groups discussions&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;h3 id="12-what-did-you-like-the-least">12. What did you like the least?&lt;/h3>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Responses:&lt;/strong> 82 people (26.45% of attendees)&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Note:&lt;/strong> Anything contained in square brackets [] is an edit by the organizers.&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Schade war, dass viel Zeit dafür verwendet wurde Dinge zu wiederholen, die man auch vorher hätte lesen können. Andererseits bereue ich das Lesen nicht, da dort viel mehr interessantes stand. Ich sehe auch, dass man nicht erwarten kann, dass alle vorbereitet zum Meeting kommen. Deshalb eine Idee, welche sich vielleicht praktisch umsetzen lässt: Beim Bilden von Untergruppen teilen wir die Leute auf zwischen denen, die zur Vorbereitung gelesen haben, und den anderen. So profitiert man zumindest dadurch von der eigenen Vorbereitung, dass man mit besser informierten Personen diskutieren kann. Ausnahme evtl. für Leute, die zum ersten Mal auftauchen.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>The conclusion to our discussion about cult. It could have been more structured. Maybe with a voting at the end from 1 to 5 how cultish this group is.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>nothing&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>The content felt not cohesive. Some consolidation could help.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Nichts&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>der Beginn hätte etwas lockerer / gesprächiger sein können&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>too much game explanation time due to new players joining in between&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Didn&amp;rsquo;t get to play any new game [Typo fixed]&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Insgesamt ist das Feedback-Formular eher unpassend für einen Spieleabend. ;)&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Exercise&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Die Diskussionen und übung hätten inhaltlich noch etwas spannendere Argumente bringen können, aber das ist halt nicht immer gleich.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Exercise was quite hard.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>I was not prepared&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>snacks :-D [This is an inside joke since some participants would like to snack less.]&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Many discussions in offtopic examples. Low abstraction level.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>less time&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>A little bit chaotic today, longer discussion in small groups would have nice, clear definition of consciousness was not given&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>First part didn&amp;rsquo;t really &amp;lsquo;introduced&amp;rsquo; what was then presented by Nawid. Felt a bit irrelevant for the discussion part.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>I think some parts of the presentations were not really relevant for the topic.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Will wasn&amp;rsquo;t fully clear about the arguments are the end. But might just need to think more about it.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Mehr Zeit, um tiefer in die Diskussion zu gehen wäre gut&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Time management&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>I would have preferred more time for discussions, maybe by splitting up the content into several Meetups.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>The discussion is not structured or guided.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Maybe spend slightly more time on the solutions.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Nothing.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Very Minor: didn&amp;rsquo;t explicitly include &amp;ldquo;some ways to problem solve&amp;rdquo; except what came up during discussion. E.g. maybe one attempt without any such discussion and then one attempt after discussing such approaches. But then, would have had time crunch&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Problems&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>The long discussion at the end about the details of a problem that has not been discussed/looked into in our group&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>/&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Nichts&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Drinking water color [The tap water at the location was yellowish, which had never happened before]&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>I had the feeling the discussions today didn&amp;rsquo;t lead to a point. But that&amp;rsquo;s okay.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Fewer people than expected so the size of the room and amount of snacks did not match those expectations.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>People quiostioning very basic stuff like probability&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Ich war schlecht vorbereitet&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Zu viele und anstrengende Steigungen. Der letzte Abstieg. Zeigt mir aber nur, dass ich mehr wandern muss ;)&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>it wasn&amp;rsquo;t an official cult hike&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Least- no hike songs and need more group photos at the start-middle-end of the hike.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Arriving home late&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>The stairs and that I need more training 😃&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Nothing&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Nichts.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Sense of exhaustion after discussion&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>I was tired&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Nothing&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>We unstructured at times but maybe a feature&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Abdriften vom Thema&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Die anderen durften auch&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>powerpoint&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>discussions were a bit long, there was no moderation&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>No known initial topic&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Maybe some more content would have been good.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Acoustics&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>45 mins felt long at the start but the video was engaging and stood well; could see some other vids not working well for the purpose. Maybe &amp;lt;25 min of content would be good&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Might have been helpful to provide some example beliefs/topics to use for the practical part of street epistemology. Or ask people to find a topic at home on beforehand.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Not enough time for the practical exercise.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>

&lt;p>Viel zu wenig Zeit zum Üben. Aber ich habe auch keine Idee, wie man das realistisch hätte verbessern können. &lt;em>Wenn&lt;/em> wir mehr Zeit zum Üben gehabt hätten (oder aber eine ungerade Zahl gewesen wären), hätte man auch Dreiergruppen bilden können: Die dritte Person beobachtet nur und schreibt auf, was man hätte verbessern können.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Some detail aspects were hard to follow.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Too many questions in between.&lt;/p>

&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>SE didn&amp;rsquo;t work the other times&lt;/p>

&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Ich hatte etwas Zahnweh&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Some Background Text or Input on strategies wouldve veen helpful&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Time management&lt;/p>

&lt;p>The uncertainty&lt;/p>

&lt;p>That I didn&amp;rsquo;t prepare&amp;hellip; :-(&lt;/p>

&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Nobody (myself included) seemed to be really well prepared so the discussions were a little shallow.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>No exercises&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>

&lt;p>Being a fascist&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Results of practical session were not presented.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Technical issues with beamer etc.&lt;/p>

&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Not entirely my topic&amp;hellip;&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Would have preferred to read the text in advance, instead of during the event&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>The presentation could have been a bit longer&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Den Text hätte ich gerne vor der Veranstaltung gelesen und die Zeit für weitere Diskussionen genutzt&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>The discussions were sometimes a little bit shallow and I would have liked to dive deeper into some details of the readings.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Surprising antipathy against trying something new&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Dass wir uns auf kein Ritual einigen konnten&lt;/p>

&lt;p>The thought of the risks to make something up, that does not feels suiteable to the group.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Many of us had introductory statistics in college but have forgotten most of
it. For many reasons having a good mastery of statistics is important e.g. to
follow the scientific discourse.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Goal: Achieve mastery of the material covered in a standard &amp;ldquo;Statistics 101&amp;rdquo;
college course. Mastery means something a little beyond just being able to
theoretically pass an exam, rather actually getting a good intuitive grasp of
the material.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We are working through the text book &amp;ldquo;Statistics&amp;rdquo; by Freedman, Pisani and Purves.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If you are interested in joining the study group please come to a &lt;a href="https://www.rationality-freiburg.de/events/">meetup&lt;/a> first.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="process">Process&lt;/h2>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>We go chapter by chapter.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Everyone studies the chapter on their own and does all the exercises, to the
best of their ability.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>We ask questions in a Signal messenger group and share resources (links,
videos) that help with particular parts.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>One person prepares the entire chapter as the teacher. We rotate who that
person is for each chapter.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>All the others are the students. They each prepare one hard question to test the
teacher on the material.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>We meet every two weeks for two hours:
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>The teacher explains the entire chapter in 30 minutes. Everyone in theory
already knows everything so its most beneficial for the teacher themself,
but it is good re-inforcement for everyone.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The teacher hides one lie in their lecture.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The students have to find the lie.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The students ask the teacher their question to verify the teacher&amp;rsquo;s
knowledge.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>We discuss any parts of the material or exercises that were unclear to
anyone.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Finally, we eat something and relax 😊.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;/li>

&lt;h2 id="feedback">Feedback&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>After (almost) every event I collected feedback from people. Here is just a
list of things people have said, without any context. Is this useful? Possibly
not, but it might give a general impression whether people enjoy coming (they
do!). It was also noted a few times that negative feedback actually lead to
changes, which was appreciated by participants. If after a feedback it says x3
it means 3 people reported the same.&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>The discussion went off rails at times. The discussion group was too big.
[Solution: Split the group] x3&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Having such a discussion in English is hard. [Solution: Split the group into
German and English]&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Having a public feedback round is not so great. [Solution: Distribute paper
for written feedback]&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Doing something hands-on was very nice.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>The meeting place was great [Stadtgarten].&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>I liked the playful character of the calibration game.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>We should keep some instrumental rationality in every meetup.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Very well prepared, with Snacks etc.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Discussions need to start off a common ground. People may have very different
knowledge. Today it was good.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>A lot of fun.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Good balance of moderation/leading the discussion and letting people discuss
by Omar.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>There was little time to do the Double Crux.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>People came a little late, which initially left me fearing that nobody would
come.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Double Crux does not work well with 3 persons.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Everyone felt that it was a useful technique and that we should do it again
in the future.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>The group size was ideal.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Practical exercises were very good.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>We did not discuss one of the posts that we wanted to and instead went off
topic. We should try to stick to our plan.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>I liked your and X’s contributions a lot and most other people were good too.
One person was terrible and I don’t know how to manage people like that, I
think you did your best. I liked everyone else. The structure was pretty good
and your moderating was pretty good, I’d just echo what other people said
about time allocation.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Overton Gymnastics is a good exercise!&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Very interesting to see a meetup with people who are all quite new to
rationality!&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>The game [exercise] was not well explained at all!!&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>I found the Sequences posts rather boring / not super interesting.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;m not sure if having newbies to rationality in the group is a good idea.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Maybe more moderation?&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Great seeing all of you again!&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Happy to again exchange thoughts with all of you.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>The dynamic of the discussion round was not ideal this time.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Not enough air circulation [because of COVID].&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>We should allocate fixed time slots to every post [to avoid the discussion
getting too deep into other subjects].&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>The group was too large [10 people] for one discussion round.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Discussing three posts [as we did] and not more is ideal.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>We should have split into two groups of five people.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>There was not enough time for the exercise. The discussion should only take
up half the time.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Please arrive 5 minutes before the start to avoid the entire session starting
15 minutes late.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>5 people group size is good. x2&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Prediction game. Manifold Markets. The chosen questions. All very nice.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Well organized.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Interesting experience. I will come back. I was irritated by the music
[coming in through the windows from the street]. The UI from Manifold Markets
is confusing and I won&amp;rsquo;t be using it. 2 hours was too short for the event.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>I was missing a little more &amp;ldquo;instrumental rationality&amp;rdquo; e.g. TAPs.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Giving a short summary of every text is a good custom that we should keep up
[we did not do it this time] for people who have not read the texts. One
person is responsible.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>The goal of the meetup was unclear beforehand. I was unaware it was so
formal. It would have been better to arrive on time. If you host such a
structured meetup it would be better to go all the way and make it even more
formal. Having conversations about [ACX] posts would happen naturally during
dinner anyway.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>I really liked the meetup.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>The exercise was weird.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>I really liked the summaries of the ACX posts.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Thank you for organizing this. I appreciate very much how serious you take
feedback and how attentive you are as a organizer by adapting the meetup
according to it. There is however a risk that catering too much to the
participants could lead to stagnation of the group. Nevertheless, trying to
keep things in flux (for better or worse) is a great quality for an organizer
and is better than sticking only with one formula.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>It was my first time in the group. I think it is very unusual to find people
who try to do such exercises to improve themselves. The exercise [falling
drill] was not very effective because it was clear that it was only a
simulation.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>During the exercise [falling drill] I was in fact wrong about something where
in fact I thought I would be right. That was unexpected, but it was very easy
for me to admit this and that is unusual. Usually it&amp;rsquo;s hard for me to admit a
mistake, but I felt comfortable doing it in this group.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>During the first part of the meetup it would have been better to go deeper
into one or two ACX posts instead of briefly presenting one per person.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>I will return!&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>It was my first time and the first round [discussing ACX posts] was great! It
gave me new things to consider that I had never thought about. Concerning the
game [falling drill] I already train being able to be wrong a lot so I
probably fail more often in the opposite direction [being too unsure], so it
wasn&amp;rsquo;t very effective for me.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>The setting was too artificial for the game [falling drill].&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>I really appreciate your [organizer&amp;rsquo;s] work. We should have spent more time
on the first round [discussing ACX posts]. It was too short.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Forming two groups of 5-6 people was great! The perfect size. In bigger
groups people get lost.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>It was a very nice way of spending the evening.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>I am blown away by the effort you invested in preparing this.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>The accoustics of the room were annoying.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>The group size was ideal.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>The exercise [falling drill] would work better if you had to give confidence
intervals and could be criticized for choosing those badly.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Best: Hike on the next day.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Best: Getting to know new people and discussing our favourite posts from the
ACX/SSC blogs.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Best: Discussing our favourite articles by Scott, and also the hike on the
day after.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Best: The sheer number of new, astonishing insights.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Best: Level of conversation was high.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Best: Improving my ability to say out loud when I&amp;rsquo;m wrong, without feeling
bad about it.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Worst: The room.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Worst: Felt a tiny(!) bit cultish.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Worst: Disturbing political opinions.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Worst: The location was uninspiring.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Worst: The room had bad accoustics.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>I don’t like going to restaurants that much, it’s much more expensive than
what I usually spend on food.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Less structured meetings or a way to branch ideas into spin-off
collaborations in a structured context might make me more excited to come.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Omar is cool. He’s a little obsessed with perfection. He needs to loosen up a
bit. These things take time to grow.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Interesting concepts shared. Rationality is certainly a toolkit that can be
applied in everything and can benefit many people and a lot of lives. But
it’s not universally seen as a good because it’s a competitor to many classic
frameworks like organized religion. So developing a model that competes on
the same playing field is tough.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>The exercise [Hamming circle] was probably helpful for an issue I have been
thinking about for several years.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>I was not so happy that only four people came.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>What you [the organizer] are doing here is really valuable.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>I enjoyed the exercise [Hamming circle]. It made me make up my mind.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>We should keep the exercise part of the meetup.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>I really enjoyed it.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>I liked the Hamming circle very much. Especially having to turn around while
the advisors were discussing, something which I had anticipated I wouldn&amp;rsquo;t
like.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>The discussion round about &amp;ldquo;Trusting experts&amp;rdquo; didn&amp;rsquo;t get to the core of the
issue. It would have required drawing on the whiteboard and a couple of hours
of time.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Acoustics of the room were great.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>TAPs was interesting.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Getting to know cool people.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>I didn&amp;rsquo;t get Occam&amp;rsquo;s razor.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Lack of structure and bad time allocation.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Valuable meeting.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>I liked the mix of discussions and practical things.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>I liked both parts.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Very nice joint event [with EA Freiburg].&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>I learnt something. x2&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Nice mix of input and exercises.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>I am glad it was so interactive.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Interesting. It took longer than expected to get into the subject [long
introduction]. I liked it.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>I liked the refreshed [on probability theory]. Took too long to get started.
It would have been better to define some terms and present a clear agenda for
the evening upfront.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>I liked it. It was a good refresher. I was missing a little the &amp;ldquo;how to apply
it&amp;rdquo; part.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Good mix of presentation and exercises. Good refresher.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Fun and interesting.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>The content of the talk has good applicability to life.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Considering the prior probability of events before evaluating the evidence
was something I had not thought about before.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>I have a better understanding of Bayes&amp;rsquo; theorem now.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Timing was not optimal. It would have been better to have more time to think
about a strategy for the Poker game.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>I realized that I do not think enough about priors.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>You should have focused a little bit more about why our intuition fails us
and how to come to a better intuitive grasp of these concepts.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>It opened new perspectives.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>The talk was well prepared.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul></description></item><item><title>Our Social Contract</title><link>https://www.rationality-freiburg.de/posts/our-social-contract/</link><pubDate>Sun, 16 Oct 2022 19:51:41 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://www.rationality-freiburg.de/posts/our-social-contract/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;strong>UPDATE 2023-01-23:&lt;/strong> This post was a proposal, but it has not been
implemented and will not be implemented in this form! There are currently no
meetup rules. The reasons for this is that several people were unhappy about
the proposal and there was a general fear that these rules would be offputting
for new people. Nonetheless, punctuality and preparation are much appreciated.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>What is the purpose of our meetups? Surprisingly, not an easy question to
answer. For me, it is having a place and time where I am challenged, surprised
and intellectually stimulated. Where I feel safe to share a part of myself.
Where I can learn and grow.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This is what I want for myself and what I want to provide for you, the guests,
the participants.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>A gathering is a social contract, even though we frequently resist thinking in
such transactional terms because it seems cold. The organizer gives you
something, or at least promises to, and the participant gives something in
return. Frequently their time and energy, sometimes their money.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The organizer has the privilege and burden of ensuring that the gathering
fulfills its purpose and that every participant gets what they were promised.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Sometimes this is in conflict with what a particular participant wants in a
particular moment.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>For example, if a meetup has started and a round of introduction is through,
everyone has shared a small piece of themselves. An atmosphere of trust and
commitment has been created. And, suddenly, one new person arrives. This new
person will have missed all this introduction, and will therefore, gain less
from the gathering than the others. But, even more, they are also taking away
something from the other participants. There is a small disruption to the
atmosphere that had been created. People don&amp;rsquo;t know this new person. Or even if
they do, they can&amp;rsquo;t sense what mood they bring. The relaxation, the leaving
behind of the world outside, is threatened. So, everyone loses a little bit.
All of this just to benefit the person who came late. They will get 70% of the
benefit of the gathering, at the cost of making it a little bit worse for
everyone else.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The same thing is true if there was an agreement to prepare in some way for the
event. If everyone except one person prepares, then that one person will get
all the benefit of all the work the other people invested, but they themselves
will give nothing in return. It is an unfair trade.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The duty of the organizer is to preserve the atmosphere, the purpose and the
fairness of the gathering. This is an intuition I have had for a long time.
Reading Priya Parker&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;The Art of Gathering&amp;rdquo; made me confident enough to
express and demand it.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I therefore, propose the following rules for our gatherings. I request and want
feedback on and criticism of this proposal, but I won&amp;rsquo;t easily be swayed
because I care, very strongly, about these meetups and their purpose.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>After having expressed some of my thoughts during the last meetup, I already
got feedback from multiple people. I am very grateful for that! That feedback
has helped shape what follows.&lt;/p>
&lt;h1 id="rules-punctuality--preparation">Rules (Punctuality &amp;amp; Preparation)&lt;/h1>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>The rules do not apply to people who come for the first time, because they
can&amp;rsquo;t be expected to know them.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The first 15 minutes of the meetup will be considered arrival time for
informal chatting, snacking and setting up. You may arrive at any time
within those 15 minutes. In order to accomodate this, the meetup duration
will be extended from 2 to 2.5 hours.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>If you arrive 16 minutes or more after the announced start time, you will be
considered &lt;em>latecomer&lt;/em>.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>If you do not prepare for the meetup in the way described in the invitation,
you will be considered &lt;em>unprepared&lt;/em>. This is only based on your own word. If
you say you have prepared, that is good enough, no further proof is required.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>If you are &lt;em>latecomer&lt;/em> or &lt;em>unprepared&lt;/em> you must make a one-time donation to
a charity of your choice.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The amount you must donate is 1% of your monthly income or 1% of your
monthly expenses, whichever is higher. This is only based on your own word.
For example, if on average you earn 2100 € per month and spend 2300 € per
month, you must donate 23 €. You do not need to report any of your finances
to anyone. Calculating the correct amount is entirely up to you.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>If you already donate money to a charity anyway, that does not count. This
donation must be in addition to other donations.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>If you are both &lt;em>latecomer&lt;/em> and &lt;em>unprepared&lt;/em>, you must donate double the
amount.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>You must provide proof of donation (scan, photograph, printscreen) before
you can join a future meetup. If you do not, you will be asked to leave. You
may obfuscate whatever personal information you deem necessary on the proof
of donation, including the amount of the donation.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>You will sign these rules in order to symbolize that you accept them. If
you do not, you will be asked to leave.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>If the amount of preparation required for a meetup is too much or the reading
uninteresting, please give early feedback, so it can be considered. It is
perfectly acceptable to have meetups without any required preparation. We want
to have gatherings that are useful and stimulating, not make you do tedious or
useless work.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The goal of these rules is very clear: Ensure people come on time and well
prepared. If this goal is not reached, then the rules will be adapted e.g. by
increasing the donation amount.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>LWCW (LessWrong Community Weekend) 2022, Berlin</title><link>https://www.rationality-freiburg.de/posts/lwcw2022/</link><pubDate>Thu, 01 Sep 2022 07:13:04 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://www.rationality-freiburg.de/posts/lwcw2022/</guid><description>&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;Who wants to brag about something they did last week?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>That was the question posed to the entire circle of people sitting in a park in
the center of Berlin. And then one by one people started bragging and everyone
else cheered them on.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://www.rationality-freiburg.de/posts/lwcw2022/cover.jpg" alt="Berlin Reichstag at sunset" title="Berlin Reichstag at sunset">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Strictly speaking this happened after the LessWrong Community Weekend during
the &lt;em>Rationality Dojo&lt;/em> that the Berlin Community organized, but it is an
illustrative example of the unusual nature of this event.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If you were to look at the table of talks you would see: dancing, meditation,
how to make fire in the wilderness, kissing workshop, acapella singing, early
morning running, dealing with depression and anxiety, modular origami workshop,
Japanese Mahjong, neurobiology of psychedelics, crochet 101, dark arts intro to
rhetoric, &amp;hellip;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Hardly what one commonly thinks of as &lt;em>rationality&lt;/em>, is it? Well in that case
you would also see multiple talks and workshops about AI (artificial
intelligence) safety, meetup organization, wisdom, probability theory and Fermi
estimates or practical exercises such as &amp;ldquo;Circling&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;Hamming circles&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;Double
Crux&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;Gendlin&amp;rsquo;s Focusing&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>What is more, all of it was organized as an &lt;em>unconference&lt;/em>, meaning that anyone
could add a new event to the schedule at any time or just change their mind and
move it to a different slot.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Let&amp;rsquo;s not forget about Duncan Sabien&amp;rsquo;s (former CFAR - Center for Applied
Rationality - instructor and author of the &lt;a href="https://www.rationality.org/files/CFAR_Handbook_2021-01.pdf">CFAR
handbook&lt;/a>) keynote
speech &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/7WUEnh2TFSk">&amp;ldquo;The moments that matter&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a>, which had to
be delivered via video due to COVID. His key message, that the tools of
Rationality should actually be put into practice instead of theorizing,
especially in the moments where it&amp;rsquo;s hardest, really resonanted with many
participants. Does making the right choices most of the time count for nothing?
It does count, but if in the really crucial moments, the &lt;em>moments that matter&lt;/em>
you keep making the wrong decisions, what is the difference?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://www.rationality-freiburg.de/posts/lwcw2022/chairs.jpg" alt="Empty chairs are waiting…" title="Empty chairs are waiting...">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Around 150 people from all over the world, though mostly Europe, showed up and
the entire vibe was inspiring, beautiful and touching. So many fascinating
conversations in the hallways, during lunch or on the way to one of the evening
swims in the lake Wannsee.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Not a single moment of boredom could be another way of putting it. Everyone was
open and welcoming, bringing their own incredible experiences and knowledge to
the table, keeping the minds and hearts of the rest engaged.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Participants were staying in the same hostel, almost entirely booked for us, right
next to the lake, with plenty of food, Mate tea, snacks and board games.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Last but not least, just in case you are wondering about COVID protocol:
Everyone was required to test themselves with the highest quality available
antigen test, provided by the organizers, upon arrival and then every morning
before leaving their room. One of many ways in which the wonderful organizers
worked tirelessly to make the event fantastic for everyone.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Thank you, from the bottom of my heart to every single attendee and organizer!
See you next time!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If you are in or around Freiburg come to the meetups in the next months to
learn much more about the exercises and experiences of this awesome weekend!&lt;/p>

Armed with hiking boots and epistemic curiosity a car full of
aspiring Freiburger rationalists leaves the train station in Freiburg towards
Bad Herrenalb.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Marcus, one of the founders of the &lt;a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/groups/kw7Zb8DLmZtsK8g3R">Karlsruhe
group&lt;/a> had organized a
beautiful hike that was challenging and beginner friendly at the same time.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://www.rationality-freiburg.de/posts/hiking-with-rationality-karlsruhe-2022-07-03/trail.jpg" alt="The trail through the forest" title="The trail through the forest">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The group size was such that it was possible to frequently change conversation
partners and our walking speed were well matched as well as ideal for
conversing during the hike.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The inspiring topics we touched upon ranged from AI (artificial intelligence)
safety, meaningful and meaningless questions after the death of a loved one,
ethical implications of Covid triage in hospitals, what &amp;ldquo;beliefs&amp;rdquo; are all the
way to to model aeroplanes and how to measure energy efficience and heat
dissipation in your home.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://www.rationality-freiburg.de/posts/hiking-with-rationality-karlsruhe-2022-07-03/landscape.jpg" alt="Overlooking forest and villages from the Teufelsmühle" title="Overlooking forest and villages from the Teufelsmühle">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>During the break at the Teufelsmühle, Marcus unpacked a camping cooker, a
manual coffee grinder as well as a few other accessories and real espresso
cups! While we enjoyed the excellent coffee we, of course, discussed our

&lt;p>After the hike was over, the evening tapered off with a piece of cake and a
round of coffee in one of the cafés in Bad Herrenalb. Is it good to give the
waiter the (polite) feedback that their coffee is really bad? What are the
consequences of doing so or not doing so? Even the simplest of questions must
be explored!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Next time, Freiburg!&lt;/p>

by that? What I should mean is that in 8 out of 10 similar situations I would
be done by Friday and in 2 out of 10 I would not.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In reality people are frequently miscalibrated. When they say 80% it may in
fact turn out that only in 5 out of 10 similar projects they would be done by
the predicted date.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>When I ask you whether Brasil or China has a bigger landmass you might say
&amp;ldquo;China&amp;rdquo;. Then I ask &amp;ldquo;How certain are you?&amp;rdquo;. You might reply 80%.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>What do you mean by that? What you should mean is that given similar questions
you would get 8 out 10 right and 2 wrong.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Why is being miscalibrated bad? You might take a bet that you shouldn&amp;rsquo;t. You
might defend some position because you are not asking your own gut how sure you
&lt;em>really&lt;/em> are about that argument you are using.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Knowing yourself and assessing whether you can trust your intuitions or whether
you shouldn&amp;rsquo;t is a valuable skill.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The good news is that personal calibration can be trained really well. The bad
news is that it only transfers moderately well to other domains. So even if you
become very well calibrated for trivia questions you might not automatically
see an improvement in task estimation at work.&lt;/p>

to do many other things, we still managed to gather in the Stadtgarten for our
Rationality Freiburg meetup in the hope of an excellent discussion and
improvement at Rationality; we were not disappointed at all !!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We open our discussion with the blog-posts in the &lt;a href="https://www.readthesequences.com/Fake-Beliefs-Sequence">Fake Beliefs
sequence&lt;/a>, with some
snacks and sparkling water. As rationalists, we must ask ourselves about a
belief and what we expect to see to know whether the view holds the test or
not. A better way to do it would be what we do not wish to see or what
evidence would falsify the belief.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The sequence talks about &amp;lsquo;Belief in belief,&amp;rsquo; we can relate it to our lives in
many different scenarios, most notably religion. And it shows us a picture of
the exhausting tribalism we see in modern-day politics by introducing a
fascinating analogy such as Green vs. Blue.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Following the discussion, we played a game of double crux in pairs. It was a
captivating experience to discuss an issue where we disagree and then try to
identify the fundamental root cause of that disagreement. We collaborated to
to find that crux that makes us differ in opinion.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>As it is becoming customary and it is normal to feel hungry after two hours of
mental exercise, we went for some dinner in the city center in a Mexican
restaurant. Where our discussion on the double crux game continued, it is like
once you start peeling the layers, we were able to find that some parts of a
disagreement aren&amp;rsquo;t actually disagreements. In the end, we all agreed, with a
bit of practice, that it can be a very instrumental tool for resolving
conflicts.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>We did it again!</title><link>https://www.rationality-freiburg.de/posts/summary-meetup-2022-06-03/</link><pubDate>Sun, 05 Jun 2022 11:00:53 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://www.rationality-freiburg.de/posts/summary-meetup-2022-06-03/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;em>What is rationality?&lt;/em> This was the overarching question that kept our group of
11 people thinking and discussing last Friday in the Freiburger Stadtgarten.
Half of us were newcomers, but all members came from Freiburg and its vicinity.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Soon after we gathered in the Stadtgarten, Omar opened up the discussion about
the first blog-posts in the &lt;a href="https://www.readthesequences.com/Predictably-Wrong-Sequence">Predictably Wrong
Sequence&lt;/a>. The
discussion branched out into many related topics, such as the role of
rationality in morality, its interplay with feelings and the rationality in
System 1 and 2 as defined by &lt;a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/11468377-thinking-fast-and-slow">Thinking Fast and
Slow&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Following the discussion, we took a calibration quiz in which answers are given
together with a subjective confidence, similar to &lt;a href="http://confidence.success-equation.com/">Confidence
Calibration&lt;/a>. The quiz helped us to
uncover and correct biases in our confidence.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>To round off the event, we went for some dinner in the city center and ended up
at the persian restaurant Shahaneh where discussions about rationality
continued on a more light-hearted note. As the sun went down, so did also the
quality of the discussed topics. Nevertheless, it was the perfect time and
place to discuss the latest news in the Heard vs Depp trial. Turns out rational
people also have guilty pleasures 😄️&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We are all looking forward to the next meeting, this time with you there as well!&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Yesterday was the first meetup of the &lt;em>Rationality Freiburg&lt;/em> group and it was fantastic!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We were eight people in total, three of them newcomers who had found us via &lt;a href="https://www.meetup.com/rationality-freiburg/">meetup.com&lt;/a>. Also joining us were two rationalists from the &lt;em>&lt;a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/groups/kw7Zb8DLmZtsK8g3R">Karlsruhe Rationality&lt;/a>&lt;/em> community.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Meeting place was Schwabentor, Freiburg and everyone was very punctual. After an introduction round we walked up to the Kanonenplatz, enjoying the lovely weather.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Omar gave an overview of epistemic and instrumental rationality, as well as some common cognitive biases. Everyone got involved, giving examples, answering questions and reflecting on the topics.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://www.rationality-freiburg.de/posts/summary-meetup-2022-05-13/maps.jpg" alt="Maps help us move around the territory" title="Three maps on a table, one from Berlin, two from Freiburg with different resolutions">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;small>&lt;em>Maps help us move around the territory, but not all maps are equally good, just like a map from Berlin is useless to find your way around Freiburg. Epistemic rationality is about improving your map (mental model) of the territory (reality).&lt;/em>&lt;/small>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Once hunger started raising its head, the group checked several options in the city center. Since we preferred sitting outside and the streets were packed, it took us three attempts until we found a place. Being separated into two tables of four, we were forced to do some speed-dating-like switching mid dinner but this did not diminish our enjoyment.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Due to popular consensus the whole event took place in English.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We are all looking forward to the next meeting, this time with you there as well!&lt;/p>

It is about accepting the fallibility of human cognition and nevertheless striving to reach valuable conclusions. It&amp;rsquo;s applying empirical thinking to prove yourself wrong. It&amp;rsquo;s being humble and thirsty.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Rationality is not about being cold, unfeeling and robotic. It is not prioritizing abstract logic over human emotion. Rather it is accepting human emotion, both in oneself and others and understanding its beauty and purpose. If you are baffled by &lt;em>irrational&lt;/em> behaviour it&amp;rsquo;s actually you who is behaving &lt;em>irrationally&lt;/em> by expecting anything else.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Rationality is not supressing that warm glow you feel when hearing a beautiful piece of music. Rather it is bathing in that feeling. And maybe afterwards, if you are so inclined, reflecting in amazement how it is possible to produce such an effect.&lt;/p>

 &lt;/div>

&lt;p>Julia explains why epistemically it&amp;rsquo;s bad form to ask something like:&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>I can&amp;rsquo;t understand how people could think science detracts from the beauty of the physical world.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
