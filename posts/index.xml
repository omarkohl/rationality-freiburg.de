11 people thinking and discussing last Friday in the Freiburger Stadtgarten.
Half of us were newcomers, but all members came from Freiburg and its vicinity.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Soon after we gathered in the Stadtgarten, Omar opened up the discussion about
the first blog-posts in the &lt;a href="https://www.readthesequences.com/Predictably-Wrong-Sequence">Predictably Wrong
Sequence&lt;/a>. The
discussion branched out into many related topics, such as the role of
rationality in morality, its interplay with feelings and the rationality in
System 1 and 2 as defined by &lt;a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/11468377-thinking-fast-and-slow">Thinking Fast and
Slow&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Following the discussion, we took a calibration quiz in which answers are given
together with a subjective confidence, similar to &lt;a href="http://confidence.success-equation.com/">Confidence
Calibration&lt;/a>. The quiz helped us to
uncover and correct biases in our confidence.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>To round off the event, we went for some dinner in the city center and ended up
at the persian restaurant Shahaneh where discussions about rationality
continued on a more light-hearted note. As the sun went down, so did also the
quality of the discussed topics. Nevertheless, it was the perfect time and
place to discuss the latest news in the Heard vs Depp trial. Turns out rational
people also have guilty pleasures 😄️&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We are all looking forward to the next meeting, this time with you there as well!&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Yesterday was the first meetup of the &lt;em>Rationality Freiburg&lt;/em> group and it was fantastic!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We were eight people in total, three of them newcomers who had found us via &lt;a href="https://www.meetup.com/rationality-freiburg/">meetup.com&lt;/a>. Also joining us were two rationalists from the &lt;em>&lt;a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/groups/kw7Zb8DLmZtsK8g3R">Karlsruhe Rationality&lt;/a>&lt;/em> community.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Meeting place was Schwabentor, Freiburg and everyone was very punctual. After an introduction round we walked up to the Kanonenplatz, enjoying the lovely weather.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Omar gave an overview of epistemic and instrumental rationality, as well as some common cognitive biases. Everyone got involved, giving examples, answering questions and reflecting on the topics.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="maps.jpg" alt="Maps help us move around the territory" title="Three maps on a table, one from Berlin, two from Freiburg with different resolutions">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;small>&lt;em>Maps help us move around the territory, but not all maps are equally good, just like a map from Berlin is useless to find your way around Freiburg. Epistemic rationality is about improving your map (mental model) of the territory (reality).&lt;/em>&lt;/small>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Once hunger started raising its head, the group checked several options in the city center. Since we preferred sitting outside and the streets were packed, it took us three attempts until we found a place. Being separated into two tables of four, we were forced to do some speed-dating-like switching mid dinner but this did not diminish our enjoyment.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Due to popular consensus the whole event took place in English.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We are all looking forward to the next meeting, this time with you there as well!&lt;/p>

It is about accepting the fallibility of human cognition and nevertheless striving to reach valuable conclusions. It&amp;rsquo;s applying empirical thinking to prove yourself wrong. It&amp;rsquo;s being humble and thirsty.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Rationality is not about being cold, unfeeling and robotic. It is not prioritizing abstract logic over human emotion. Rather it is accepting human emotion, both in oneself and others and understanding its beauty and purpose. If you are baffled by &lt;em>irrational&lt;/em> behaviour it&amp;rsquo;s actually you who is behaving &lt;em>irrationally&lt;/em> by expecting anything else.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Rationality is not supressing that warm glow you feel when hearing a beautiful piece of music. Rather it is bathing in that feeling. And maybe afterwards, if you are so inclined, reflecting in amazement how it is possible to produce such an effect.&lt;/p>

&lt;/div>
&lt;p>Julia explains why epistemically it&amp;rsquo;s bad form to ask something like:&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>I can&amp;rsquo;t understand how people could think science detracts from the beauty of the physical world.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
