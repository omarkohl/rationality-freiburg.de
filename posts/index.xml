&lt;p>That was the question posed to the entire circle of people sitting in a park in
the center of Berlin. And then one by one people started bragging and everyone
else cheered them on.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="berlin.jpg" alt="Berlin Reichstag at sunset" title="Berlin Reichstag at sunset">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Strictly speaking this happened after the LessWrong Community Weekend during
the &lt;em>Rationality Dojo&lt;/em> that the Berlin Community organized, but it is an
illustrative example of the unusual nature of this event.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If you were to look at the table of talks you would see: dancing, meditation,
how to make fire in the wilderness, kissing workshop, acapella singing, early
morning running, dealing with depression and anxiety, modular origami workshop,
Japanese Mahjong, neurobiology of psychedelics, crochet 101, dark arts intro to
rhetoric, &amp;hellip;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Hardly what one commonly thinks of as &lt;em>rationality&lt;/em>, is it? Well in that case
you would also see multiple talks and workshops about AI (artificial
intelligence) safety, meetup organization, wisdom, probability theory and Fermi
estimates or practical exercises such as &amp;ldquo;Circling&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;Hamming circles&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;Double
Crux&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;Gendlin&amp;rsquo;s Focusing&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>What is more, all of it was organized as an &lt;em>unconference&lt;/em>, meaning that anyone
could add a new event to the schedule at any time or just change their mind and
move it to a different slot.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Let&amp;rsquo;s not forget about Duncan Sabien&amp;rsquo;s keynote speech &amp;ldquo;The moments that
matter&amp;rdquo;, which had to be delivered via video. His key message, that the tools
of Rationality should actually be put into practice instead of theorizing,
especially in the moments where it&amp;rsquo;s hardest, really resonanted with many
participants. Does making the right choices most of the time count for nothing?
It does count, but if in the really crucial moments, the &lt;em>moments that matter&lt;/em>
you keep making the wrong decisions, what is the difference?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="chairs.jpg" alt="Empty chairs are waiting&amp;amp;hellip;" title="Empty chairs are waiting...">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Around 150 people from all over the world, though mostly Europe, showed up and
the entire vibe was simply inspiring, beautiful and touching. So many
fascinating conversations in the hallways, during lunch or on the way to one of
the evening swims in the lake Wannsee.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Not a single moment of boredom could be another way of putting it. Everyone was
open and welcoming, bringing their own incredible experiences and knowledge to
the table, keeping the minds and hearts of the rest engaged.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Participants were staying in the same hostel, almost entirely booked for us, right
next to the lake, with plenty of food, Mate tea, snacks and board games.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Last but not least, just in case you are wondering about COVID protocol:
Everyone was required to test themselves with the highest quality available
antigen test, provided by the organizers, upon arrival and then every morning
before leaving their room. One of many ways in which the wonderful organizers
worked tirelessly to make the event fantastic for everyone.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Thank you, from the bottom of my heart to every single attendee and organizer!
See you next time!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If you are in or around Freiburg come to the meetups in the next months to
learn much more about the exercises and experiences of this awesome weekend!&lt;/p>

Armed with hiking boots and epistemic curiosity a car full of
aspiring Freiburger rationalists leaves the train station in Freiburg towards
Bad Herrenalb.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Marcus, one of the founders of the &lt;a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/groups/kw7Zb8DLmZtsK8g3R">Karlsruhe
group&lt;/a> had organized a
beautiful hike that was challenging and beginner friendly at the same time.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="trail.jpg" alt="The trail through the forest" title="The trail through the forest">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The group size was such that it was possible to frequently change conversation
partners and our walking speed were well matched as well as ideal for
conversing during the hike.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The inspiring topics we touched upon ranged from AI (artificial intelligence)
safety, meaningful and meaningless questions after the death of a loved one,
ethical implications of Covid triage in hospitals, what &amp;ldquo;beliefs&amp;rdquo; are all the
way to to model aeroplanes and how to measure energy efficience and heat
dissipation in your home.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="landscape.jpg" alt="Overlooking forest and villages from the Teufelsmühle" title="Overlooking forest and villages from the Teufelsmühle">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>During the break at the Teufelsmühle, Marcus unpacked a camping cooker, a
manual coffee grinder as well as a few other accessories and real espresso
cups! While we enjoyed the excellent coffee we, of course, discussed our
confidence in actually being able to taste the difference vs. pretentious BS.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="group.jpg" alt="A few members of the group enjoying coffee" title="A few members of the
group enjoying coffee">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>After the hike was over, the evening tapered off with a piece of cake and a
round of coffee in one of the cafés in Bad Herrenalb. Is it good to give the
waiter the (polite) feedback that their coffee is really bad? What are the
consequences of doing so or not doing so? Even the simplest of questions must
be explored!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Next time, Freiburg!&lt;/p>

by that? What I should mean is that in 8 out of 10 similar situations I would
be done by Friday and in 2 out of 10 I would not.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In reality people are frequently miscalibrated. When they say 80% it may in
fact turn out that only in 5 out of 10 similar projects they would be done by
the predicted date.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>When I ask you whether Brasil or China has a bigger landmass you might say
&amp;ldquo;China&amp;rdquo;. Then I ask &amp;ldquo;How certain are you?&amp;rdquo;. You might reply 80%.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>What do you mean by that? What you should mean is that given similar questions
you would get 8 out 10 right and 2 wrong.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Why is being miscalibrated bad? You might take a bet that you shouldn&amp;rsquo;t. You
might defend some position because you are not asking your own gut how sure you
&lt;em>really&lt;/em> are about that argument you are using.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Knowing yourself and assessing whether you can trust your intuitions or whether
you shouldn&amp;rsquo;t is a valuable skill.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The good news is that personal calibration can be trained really well. The bad
news is that it only transfers moderately well to other domains. So even if you
become very well calibrated for trivia questions you might not automatically
see an improvement in task estimation at work.&lt;/p>

to do many other things, we still managed to gather in the Stadtgarten for our
Rationality Freiburg meetup in the hope of an excellent discussion and
improvement at Rationality; we were not disappointed at all !!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We open our discussion with the blog-posts in the &lt;a href="https://www.readthesequences.com/Fake-Beliefs-Sequence">Fake Beliefs
sequence&lt;/a>, with some
snacks and sparkling water. As rationalists, we must ask ourselves about a
belief and what we expect to see to know whether the view holds the test or
not. A better way to do it would be what we do not wish to see or what
evidence would falsify the belief.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The sequence talks about &amp;lsquo;Belief in belief,&amp;rsquo; we can relate it to our lives in
many different scenarios, most notably religion. And it shows us a picture of
the exhausting tribalism we see in modern-day politics by introducing a
fascinating analogy such as Green vs. Blue.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Following the discussion, we played a game of double crux in pairs. It was a
captivating experience to discuss an issue where we disagree and then try to
identify the fundamental root cause of that disagreement. We collaborated to
to find that crux that makes us differ in opinion.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>As it is becoming customary and it is normal to feel hungry after two hours of
mental exercise, we went for some dinner in the city center in a Mexican
restaurant. Where our discussion on the double crux game continued, it is like
once you start peeling the layers, we were able to find that some parts of a
disagreement aren&amp;rsquo;t actually disagreements. In the end, we all agreed, with a
bit of practice, that it can be a very instrumental tool for resolving
conflicts.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>We did it again!</title><link>https://www.rationality-freiburg.de/posts/summary-meetup-2022-06-03/</link><pubDate>Sun, 05 Jun 2022 11:00:53 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://www.rationality-freiburg.de/posts/summary-meetup-2022-06-03/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;em>What is rationality?&lt;/em> This was the overarching question that kept our group of
11 people thinking and discussing last Friday in the Freiburger Stadtgarten.
Half of us were newcomers, but all members came from Freiburg and its vicinity.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Soon after we gathered in the Stadtgarten, Omar opened up the discussion about
the first blog-posts in the &lt;a href="https://www.readthesequences.com/Predictably-Wrong-Sequence">Predictably Wrong
Sequence&lt;/a>. The
discussion branched out into many related topics, such as the role of
rationality in morality, its interplay with feelings and the rationality in
System 1 and 2 as defined by &lt;a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/11468377-thinking-fast-and-slow">Thinking Fast and
Slow&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Following the discussion, we took a calibration quiz in which answers are given
together with a subjective confidence, similar to &lt;a href="http://confidence.success-equation.com/">Confidence
Calibration&lt;/a>. The quiz helped us to
uncover and correct biases in our confidence.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>To round off the event, we went for some dinner in the city center and ended up
at the persian restaurant Shahaneh where discussions about rationality
continued on a more light-hearted note. As the sun went down, so did also the
quality of the discussed topics. Nevertheless, it was the perfect time and
place to discuss the latest news in the Heard vs Depp trial. Turns out rational
people also have guilty pleasures 😄️&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We are all looking forward to the next meeting, this time with you there as well!&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Yesterday was the first meetup of the &lt;em>Rationality Freiburg&lt;/em> group and it was fantastic!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We were eight people in total, three of them newcomers who had found us via &lt;a href="https://www.meetup.com/rationality-freiburg/">meetup.com&lt;/a>. Also joining us were two rationalists from the &lt;em>&lt;a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/groups/kw7Zb8DLmZtsK8g3R">Karlsruhe Rationality&lt;/a>&lt;/em> community.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Meeting place was Schwabentor, Freiburg and everyone was very punctual. After an introduction round we walked up to the Kanonenplatz, enjoying the lovely weather.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Omar gave an overview of epistemic and instrumental rationality, as well as some common cognitive biases. Everyone got involved, giving examples, answering questions and reflecting on the topics.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="maps.jpg" alt="Maps help us move around the territory" title="Three maps on a table, one from Berlin, two from Freiburg with different resolutions">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;small>&lt;em>Maps help us move around the territory, but not all maps are equally good, just like a map from Berlin is useless to find your way around Freiburg. Epistemic rationality is about improving your map (mental model) of the territory (reality).&lt;/em>&lt;/small>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Once hunger started raising its head, the group checked several options in the city center. Since we preferred sitting outside and the streets were packed, it took us three attempts until we found a place. Being separated into two tables of four, we were forced to do some speed-dating-like switching mid dinner but this did not diminish our enjoyment.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Due to popular consensus the whole event took place in English.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We are all looking forward to the next meeting, this time with you there as well!&lt;/p>

It is about accepting the fallibility of human cognition and nevertheless striving to reach valuable conclusions. It&amp;rsquo;s applying empirical thinking to prove yourself wrong. It&amp;rsquo;s being humble and thirsty.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Rationality is not about being cold, unfeeling and robotic. It is not prioritizing abstract logic over human emotion. Rather it is accepting human emotion, both in oneself and others and understanding its beauty and purpose. If you are baffled by &lt;em>irrational&lt;/em> behaviour it&amp;rsquo;s actually you who is behaving &lt;em>irrationally&lt;/em> by expecting anything else.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Rationality is not supressing that warm glow you feel when hearing a beautiful piece of music. Rather it is bathing in that feeling. And maybe afterwards, if you are so inclined, reflecting in amazement how it is possible to produce such an effect.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Julia explains why epistemically it&amp;rsquo;s bad form to ask something like:&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>I can&amp;rsquo;t understand how people could think science detracts from the beauty of the physical world.&lt;/p>
