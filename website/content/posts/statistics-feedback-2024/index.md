### 12. What did you like the least?

* **Responses:** 75 people (26.13% of attendees)

**Note:** Anything contained in square brackets [] is an edit by the organizers.

> Schade war, dass viel Zeit dafür verwendet wurde Dinge zu wiederholen, die man auch vorher hätte lesen können. Andererseits bereue ich das Lesen nicht, da dort viel mehr interessantes stand. Ich sehe auch, dass man nicht erwarten kann, dass alle vorbereitet zum Meeting kommen. Deshalb eine Idee, welche sich vielleicht praktisch umsetzen lässt: Beim Bilden von Untergruppen teilen wir die Leute auf zwischen denen, die zur Vorbereitung gelesen haben, und den anderen. So profitiert man zumindest dadurch von der eigenen Vorbereitung, dass man mit besser informierten Personen diskutieren kann. Ausnahme evtl. für Leute, die zum ersten Mal auftauchen.

> The conclusion to our discussion about cult. It could have been more structured. Maybe with a voting at the end from 1 to 5 how cultish this group is.

> nothing

> The content felt not cohesive. Some consolidation could help.

> Nichts

> - der Beginn hätte etwas lockerer / gesprächiger sein können

> too much game explanation time due to new players joining in between

> Didn't get to play any new game [Typo fixed]

> Insgesamt ist das Feedback-Formular eher unpassend für einen Spieleabend. ;)

> Exercise

> Die Diskussionen und übung hätten inhaltlich noch etwas spannendere Argumente bringen können, aber das ist halt nicht immer gleich.

> Exercise was quite hard.

> I was not prepared

> snacks :-D [This is an inside joke since some participants would like to snack less.]

> Many discussions in offtopic examples. Low abstraction level.

> less time

> A little bit chaotic today, longer discussion in small groups would have nice, clear definition of consciousness was not given

> First part didn't really 'introduced' what was then presented by Nawid. Felt a bit irrelevant for the discussion part.

> I think some parts of the presentations were not really relevant for the topic.

> Will wasn't fully clear about the arguments are the end. But might just need to think more about it.

> Mehr Zeit, um tiefer in die Diskussion zu gehen wäre gut

> Time management

> I would have preferred more time for discussions, maybe by splitting up the content into several Meetups.

> The discussion is not structured or guided.

> Maybe spend slightly more time on the solutions.

> Nothing. 

> Very Minor: didn't explicitly include "some ways to problem solve" except what came up during discussion. E.g. maybe one attempt without any such discussion and then one attempt after discussing such approaches. But then, would have had time crunch

> Problems

> The long discussion at the end about the details of a problem that has not been discussed/looked into in our group

> /

> Nichts

> Drinking water color [The tap water at the location was yellowish, which had never happened before]

> I had the feeling the discussions today didn't lead to a point. But that's okay. 

> Fewer people than expected so the size of the room and amount of snacks did not match those expectations.

> People quiostioning very basic stuff like probability 

> Ich war schlecht vorbereitet

> Zu viele und anstrengende Steigungen. Der letzte Abstieg. Zeigt mir aber nur, dass ich mehr wandern muss ;)

> it wasn't an official cult hike

> Least- no hike songs and need more group photos at the start-middle-end of the hike.

> Arriving home late 

> The stairs and that I need more training 😃

> Nothing

> Nichts.

> Sense of exhaustion after discussion 

> I was tired

> Nothing

> We unstructured at times but maybe a feature

> Abdriften vom Thema

> Die anderen durften auch

> powerpoint 

> discussions were a bit long, there was no moderation

> No known initial topic

> Maybe some more content would have been good.

> Acoustics

> 45 mins felt long at the start but the video was engaging and stood well; could see some other vids not working well for the purpose. Maybe <25 min of content would be good

> Might have been helpful to provide some example beliefs/topics to use for the practical part of street epistemology. Or ask people to find a topic at home on beforehand. 

> Not enough time for the practical exercise.

> Viel zu wenig Zeit zum Üben. Aber ich habe auch keine Idee, wie man das realistisch hätte verbessern können. _Wenn_ wir mehr Zeit zum Üben gehabt hätten (oder aber eine ungerade Zahl gewesen wären), hätte man auch Dreiergruppen bilden können: Die dritte Person beobachtet nur und schreibt auf, was man hätte verbessern können.

> Some detail aspects were hard to follow. 

> Too many questions in between.

> SE didn't work the other times

> Ich hatte etwas Zahnweh

> Technical issues with beamer etc.

> Not entirely my topic...
