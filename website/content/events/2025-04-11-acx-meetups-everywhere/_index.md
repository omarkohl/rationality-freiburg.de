## Preparation

Read at least one of the following:

* [Why I Am Not A Conflict Theorist](https://www.astralcodexten.com/p/why-i-am-not-a-conflict-theorist)
* [How To Stop Worrying And Learn To Love Lynn's National IQ Estimates](https://www.astralcodexten.com/p/how-to-stop-worrying-and-learn-to)
* (2 articles!) [Claude Fights Back](https://www.astralcodexten.com/p/claude-fights-back) and [Why Worry About Incorrigible Claude?](https://www.astralcodexten.com/p/why-worry-about-incorrigible-claude)

Bring written answers to the following questions:

* This I already **knew**
* This I did **not understand**
* This I would like to **discuss**
* These are **my ideas** on the topic

People who did not have time to prepare will read the "IQ Estimates" article,
which is the shortest, during the meetup and only then join a discussion group.


## What will we do?

We will split into discussion groups depending on which article you read and
then discuss the answers the participants brought.

## Organization

You are worried you have nothing to contribute? No worries! Everyone is
welcome!

There always is a mix of German and English speakers and we configure the
discussion rounds so that everyone feels comfortable participating. The primary
language is English.

This meetup will be hosted by Omar.

There will be snacks and drinks.

We will go and get dinner after the meetup. Anyone who has time is welcome to
join.
