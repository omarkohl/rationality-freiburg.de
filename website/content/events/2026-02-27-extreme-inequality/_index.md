## Preparation

None.


## What will we do?

Why do we talk so much about poverty but so little about wealth? Is inequality a real societal problem or an inevitable byproduct of modern societies? And can it be reduced without sacrificing growth or freedom?

This talk focuses on wealth inequality in rich countries. We will examine how extremely concentrated wealth is today and what consequences this has for democracy, health, social cohesion, and economic development.

In the second part, we turn to solutions: What policy instruments could address inequality at the top of the distribution? What role do taxes on high wealth and inheritances play? And how realistic is their implementation from a technical and political perspective, including in Germany?

The talk draws on insights from inequality research and is intended as a starting point for a joint discussion.


## Organization

You are worried you have nothing to contribute? No worries! Everyone is
welcome!

There always is a mix of German and English native speakers and we configure
discussion rounds so that everyone feels comfortable participating. The
presentation will be in English.

This meetup will be hosted by Jenny.

There will be snacks and drinks.

We will go for dinner after the meetup. Everyone who has time is welcome to
join.
