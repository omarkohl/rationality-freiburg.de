## What will we do?

Meeting point is 08:55 a.m. sharp at the main entrance of the Freiburg main
train station.

We will take the train at 09:10 a.m. with final destination Hebelhof, Feldberg.
From there we will hike about 12km to the "Hasenhorn Rodelbahn", which will
leave us in Todtnau. From there we will return via public transport to Freiburg
main train station. We will picknick along the way so bring sandwiches, snacks etc.

Here is the complete route: https://www.outdooractive.com/de/route/wanderung/schwarzwald/feldberg-herzogenhorn-hasenhorn/290359153/

Learn more about the Rodelbahn https://www.hasenhorn-rodelbahn.de/ . People who
are not comfortable with it can take a cable car instead or walk down (it's
rather steep though and takes about 45 minutes).

The hike is meant to be kid friendly and there are two spots where the hike can
be shortened if necessary.

If you prefer you can also join the hike directly in Feldberg. We will leave
there at 10:30 a.m.
