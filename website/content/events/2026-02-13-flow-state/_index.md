## Preparation

Previous knowledge is not required. Suggested reading:

* A Review on the Role of the Neuroscience of Flow States in the Modern World.
  https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7551835/
* Book "Finding Flow: The Psychology of Engagement With Everyday Life." by
  Mihály Csíkszentmihályi

## What will we do?

What makes an enjoyable life? In the quest to understand how some people remain
happy even in adverse circumstances, the Hungarian-American psychologist Mihály
Csíkszentmihályi did groundbreaking research on a unique kind of fulfilling,
productive, and optimal experiences, which he coined "flow state." Popularly
known as being "in the zone", this is characterized by a deep immersion in an
activity, with heightened awareness, optimized performance, and intrinsic
reward. Across cultures and in the most different occupations, he observed that
"the experience itself is so enjoyable that people will do it even at great
cost, for the sheer sake of doing it.”

In a 25-minute introduction, we will dive into the concept of flow state, its
psychological and neurophysiological correlates, and tips to enhance flow in our
lives. We will do some exercises to get into a flow state. We will discuss these
and related topics in smaller groups to share ideas and personal experiences.

## Organization

You are worried you have nothing to contribute? No worries! Everyone is
welcome!

There always is a mix of German and English speakers and we configure the
discussion rounds so that everyone feels comfortable participating. The primary
language is English.

This meetup will be hosted by Ana.

There will be snacks and drinks.

We will go and get dinner after the meetup. Anyone who has time is welcome to
join.
