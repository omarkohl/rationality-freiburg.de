## Preparation

To be defined.


## What will we do?

Harry Potter and the Methods of Rationality (HPMoR) is a work of fiction by
Eliezer Yudkowksy that is hugely popular in the rationality community and for
many people the first point of contact. We will present the work and jointly
discover and discuss it. No previous knowledge of HPMoR is expected.

More information: https://hpmor.com/


## Organization

You are worried you have nothing to contribute? No worries! Everyone is
welcome!

There always is a mix of German and English speakers and we configure the
discussion rounds so that everyone feels comfortable participating. The primary
language is English.

This meetup will be hosted by Ben.

There will be snacks and drinks.

We will go and get dinner after the meetup. Anyone who has time is welcome to
join.
