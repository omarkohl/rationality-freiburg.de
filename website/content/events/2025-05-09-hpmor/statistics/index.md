* **Responses:** 12 people (63.16% of attendees)

**Note:** Anything contained in square brackets [] is an edit by the organizers.

> Nich genug Zeit um meine Gedanken zwischendrin zu sortieren 

> Today we were lacking a bit of interactivity

> spoilers

> The presentation was good albeit a bit slow at times. It would also have been better to prepare something additional e.g. an exercise or something interactive related to HPMOR.

> Beginning and waiting 

> Duration

> Lower amount of regulars, than I expected
