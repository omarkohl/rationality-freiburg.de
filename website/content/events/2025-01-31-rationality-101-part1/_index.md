## Update 31.01

* Anki deck: [Rationality 101 - Part 1.apkg](<Rationality 101 - Part 1.apkg>)
* Slides: [2025-01-31-rationality101-v2.pdf](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/omarkohl/rationality-freiburg.de/15e3979c/slides/2025-01-31-rationality101/2025-01-31-rationality101-v2.pdf)

## Preparation

If possible, bring a **laptop** or **smartphone** to the meetup.

Read the following article. If you can't, that's ok, you will be given time during the meetup to do so:

- [Why Facts Don’t Change Our Minds - The New Yorker](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2017/02/27/why-facts-dont-change-our-minds)

While reading, prepare **written notes** (paper, phone, laptop) for the following four points:

- This I already **knew**
- This I did **not understand**
- This I would like to **discuss**
- These are **my ideas** on the topic


## What will we do?

Ever wondered **why we believe what we believe** or how to tell fact from fiction in today’s whirlwind of information? Join us for a fun and interactive workshop. We’ll dive into the secrets of epistemic rationality – the science (and a little magic) of seeing the world as it truly is.

This session is especially designed for newcomers to rationality, so **no prior experience is needed**. Bring your curiosity and your questions – and why not bring a friend along to share the experience? Expect an engaging mix of **group discussions, exercises, and "aha!" moments** as we uncover the quirks of human thinking and how to outsmart them.

People who were unable to read the preparation text beforehand will be given time during the meetup and will join the discussion afterwards.


## Organization

You are worried you have nothing to contribute? No worries! Everyone is
welcome!

There always is a mix of German and English speakers and we configure the
discussion rounds so that everyone feels comfortable participating. The primary
language is English.

This meetup will be hosted by Omar.

There will be snacks and drinks.

We will go and get dinner after the meetup. Anyone who has time is welcome to
join.
