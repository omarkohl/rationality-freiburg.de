**IMPORTANT:** This is a closed meetup, meaning it is only meant for people who
have attended at least ONE previous event. Please do not come if this does not

everyone is welcome. Anything listed there is 100% open to anyone.


## Preparation

Let the host know that you are attending e.g. via Signal if you are already in
the group chat or via email omar@ratfr.de .


## What will we do?

We will commemorate Petrov Day.

Stanislav Petrov was a Soviet military officer who, on September 26, 1983, made a critical decision that potentially averted a nuclear war. On that day, the Soviet Union's early-warning systems detected what appeared to be an incoming missile strike from the United States. Despite the alarms and warnings, Petrov judged that the reports were likely false alarms and chose not to escalate the situation by reporting it to his superiors. His decision was later confirmed to be correct, as it turned out to be a malfunction in the detection system.

**Note:** This event will be followed by [Board Games]({{< ref "/events/2025-09-26-board-games" >}}) at 18:00 in the same building (different room). You're welcome to join both events!


## Organization

You are worried you have nothing to contribute? No worries! Everyone is
welcome!

There always is a mix of German and English speakers and we configure the
discussion rounds so that everyone feels comfortable participating. The primary
language is English.

This meetup will be hosted by Omar.

There will be snacks and drinks.
