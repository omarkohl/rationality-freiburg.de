## Preparation

None.


## What will we do?

I will give a 45 minute presentation summarizing the new book "If Anyone Builds It, Everyone Dies" by Eliezer Yudkowsky and Nate Soares on the topic of existential risk due to AI (artificial intelligence). Then we will discuss thoughts and objections you have in small groups.


## Organization

You are worried you have nothing to contribute? No worries! Everyone is
welcome!

There always is a mix of German and English speakers and we configure the
discussion rounds so that everyone feels comfortable participating. The primary
language is English.

This meetup will be hosted by Omar.

There will be snacks and drinks.

We will go and get dinner after the meetup. Anyone who has time is welcome to
join.
