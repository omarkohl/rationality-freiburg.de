**IMPORTANT:** This is a closed meetup, meaning it is only meant for people who
have attended at least ONE previous event. Please do not come if this does not
apply to you! [Why? Read this.]({{< ref "posts/closed-meetups" >}}) Check the
[list of events]({{< ref "events" >}}) to find the next public event, where
everyone is welcome. Anything listed there is 100% open to anyone.


## Preparation

Bring a laptop or smartphone.


## What Will We Do?

We will split into pairs, and each pair will receive a **shortened Wikipedia article**. These articles will contain **between zero and ten factual errors**—but you won’t know how many!  

### **Phase 1: Investigation**  
Each pair will **analyze their article**, identifying potential inaccuracies and making any corrections they deem necessary. Once finished, they will prepare a **summary** to present to the group.  

### **Phase 2: The Challenge**  
Once all pairs are ready, we will **reconvene as a group**, and each pair will present their topic. The twist? **The audience must try to spot the original (possibly non-existent) errors!**  

### **Phase 3: The Reveal & Discussion**  
After the audience has made their guesses, we’ll **reveal the actual changes** that were made to the original article. Finally, we’ll have an **open discussion**.  

This event is a fun way to test your critical thinking, challenge your assumptions, and practice being wrong.

## Organization

You are worried you have nothing to contribute? No worries! Everyone is
welcome!

There always is a mix of German and English speakers and we configure the
discussion rounds so that everyone feels comfortable participating. The primary
language is English.

This meetup will be hosted by Omar.

There will be snacks and drinks.

We will go and get dinner after the meetup. Anyone who has time is welcome to
join.
