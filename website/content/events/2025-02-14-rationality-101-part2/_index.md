## Preparation

If possible, bring a **laptop** or **smartphone** to the meetup.

Read the following article. If you can't, that's ok, you will be given time during the meetup to do so:

- [Stupidity: Our biggest threat?](https://onepercentrule.substack.com/p/stupidity-our-biggest-threat)

While reading, prepare **written notes** (paper, phone, laptop) for the following four points:

- This I already **knew**
- This I did **not understand**
- This I would like to **discuss**
- These are **my ideas** on the topic

**Optional:** In addition you can read [The Spiral of Wrath: The crash of Armavia flight 967](https://admiralcloudberg.medium.com/the-spiral-of-wrath-the-crash-of-armavia-flight-967-c7d84541f0f7). It's optional because even though it's fascinating it's also quite long. There will be one discussion group specifically for people who prepared this text. While reading, make notes of good and bad decisions the people involved made. Write down your thoughts for what the causes in each case are.


## What will we do?

Join us for the second session of Rationality 101! This interactive workshop focuses on **instrumental rationality** – the practical **tools and strategies** for making better **decisions** and achieving your **goals** effectively.

In this session, we’ll dive into topics like **decision theory**, setting coherent **goals**, and the critical link between rationality and success. You’ll learn how to align your actions with your objectives, evaluate trade-offs, and maximize the impact of your choices. Through engaging **discussions, hands-on exercises, and collaborative problem-solving**, you’ll leave with actionable insights to apply in your personal and professional life.

Whether you attended [Part 1]({{< ref "events/2025-01-31-rationality-101-part1" >}}) or are **joining us for the first time**, this session is designed to be **accessible and impactful for everyone**. Bring your curiosity, your questions, and your friends as we unlock the secrets of practical rationality together!

## Organization

You are worried you have nothing to contribute? No worries! **Everyone is
welcome!**

There always is a mix of **German and English speakers** and we configure the
discussion rounds so that everyone feels comfortable participating. The primary
language is English.

This meetup will be hosted by Omar.

There will be snacks and drinks.

We will go and get **dinner after the meetup**. Anyone who has time is welcome to
join.
