**Note:** The originally scheduled event "The Science of Cell Culture" has been postponed to [January 16th, 2026]({{< ref "/events/2026-01-16-science-of-cell-culture" >}}). If you were looking forward to that event, please mark the new date in your calendar!

## Preparation

Bring your favorite board games or card games if you have any! But don't worry if you don't - we usually have plenty of games available.


## What will we do?

We'll play games! This is a relaxed social evening where we'll enjoy various board games, card games, and party games together. Whether you prefer strategy games, social deduction games, or cooperative games, there will be something for everyone. We'll form groups based on the number of participants and the games people bring or want to play.

This is a great opportunity to meet fellow rationality enthusiasts in a casual, fun environment while exercising strategic thinking and social skills through gaming.


## Organization

You are worried you have nothing to contribute? No worries! Everyone is
welcome!

There always is a mix of German and English speakers and we configure the
discussion rounds so that everyone feels comfortable participating. The primary
language is English.

This meetup will be hosted by Omar.

There will be snacks and drinks.

We will go and get dinner after the meetup. Anyone who has time is welcome to
join.
