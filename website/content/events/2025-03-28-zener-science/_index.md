## What will we do?

Do you believe in ESP (extra sensory perception)? Why or why not? What would convince you that you are wrong? Today we will experimentally test ESP by splitting into groups, designing an experimental setup, trying to read each other's mind and recording the results.

Finally each group will present their findings to all participants and we'll discuss them.


## Organization

You are worried you have nothing to contribute? No worries! Everyone is
welcome!

There always is a mix of German and English speakers and we configure the
discussion rounds so that everyone feels comfortable participating. The primary
language is English.

This meetup will be hosted by Omar.

There will be snacks and drinks.

We will go and get dinner after the meetup. Anyone who has time is welcome to
join.
