### 11. What did you like the most today?

* **Responses:** 10 people (52.63% of attendees)

**Note:** Anything contained in square brackets [] is an edit by the organizers.

> nice people

> It was a great idea to ask people to write down their "when to act" thresholds and estimates beforehand since then the numbers shown during the presentation were suddenly much more meaningful.

> listening to the various perceptions of others

> Actually changing some minds

> Discussion & seeing other's probabilities

> Interesting topic, good discussion 

> The lively discussion

> Die Gruppendiskussion am Ende

> people

> Pondering about a topic that I usually would not take time to investigate.
### 12. What did you like the least?

* **Responses:** 9 people (47.37% of attendees)

**Note:** Anything contained in square brackets [] is an edit by the organizers.

> a little more time for group discussion would have been nice (also at least one swapping of people in the smaller group)

> Micro-optimization: Instead of suggesting updating the estimates for every slide it might have been better to have 4 checkpoints during the presentation where participants were explicitly asked "now revise your estimates, if you want to, you have 2 minutes". It would also have given more space on the page to write.

> I would've liked a bit more time to discuss in small groups

> Forgot some things

> Snacks

> The Room was too cold!

> The lack of deep explanation /arguments for each prediction

> location is far lol

> I was expecting fact based probability calculations. Just trying to come up with numbers without any facts didn't make much sense
