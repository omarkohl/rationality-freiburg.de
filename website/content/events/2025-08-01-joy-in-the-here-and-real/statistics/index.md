### 12. What did you like the least?

* **Responses:** 7 people (31.82% of attendees)

> konnte manches nicht verstehen

> Maybe that it wasn’t so much structured, we could talk about a certain aspect of having joy in life. 

> Learning about the low Baseline Happiness.

> We went quite off-topic at times but quite fine still 

> No presentation

> Few really new ideas for me. Bit superficial messages occasionally. A bit more input or discussable statements would have been nice instead of very long discussion time.

> It would have liked the group constellations to have been a bit more structured, it felt a bit chaotic.
