## Preparation

Please come unprepared!


## What will we do?

How do we know the distance to the moon? How did we discover the orbits of the planets? 

Beginning in the era of the greek philosophers and armed with the tools of their time, we are going to 
deduce the scale of our solar system step by step -- and uncover some remarkable insights that laid 
the foundation for our modern understanding.


## Organization

You are worried you have nothing to contribute? No worries! Everyone is
welcome!

There always is a mix of German and English speakers and we configure the
discussion rounds so that everyone feels comfortable participating. The primary
language is English.

This meetup will be hosted by Nawid.

There will be snacks and drinks.

We will go and get dinner after the meetup. Anyone who has time is welcome to
join.
