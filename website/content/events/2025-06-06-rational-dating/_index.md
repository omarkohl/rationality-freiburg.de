## Preparation

Read the following texts:

* [Coupling for Decouplers - Jacob Falkovich](https://www.secondperson.dating/p/decouplers)
* [Markets in Dating - Jacob Falkovich](https://www.secondperson.dating/p/markets-in-dating)
* [Dating: Accordions Vs. Sitars - Aella](https://knowingless.com/2017/10/21/dating-accordions-vs-sitars/)
* [Nice Guy Anti-FAQ - Damon Sasi](https://daystareld.com/nice-guy-anti-faq/)


## What will we do?

We will split into small groups and discuss the above texts. Then we will share
dating and relationship experience and give advice to people who want advice.
If you want, you can bring specific scenarios, stories or text messages to
share and discuss.

Given that the topic can be very personal we will try to create groups where
everyone feels comfortable with the other people. This means that re-mixing groups
may be hard and that people who seldomly come to meetups may be at a
disadvantage, so please take that into consideration if this applies to you.


## Organization

You are worried you have nothing to contribute? No worries! Everyone is
welcome!

There always is a mix of German and English speakers and we configure the
discussion rounds so that everyone feels comfortable participating. The primary
language is English.

This meetup will be hosted by Omar.

There will be snacks and drinks.

We will go and get dinner after the meetup. Anyone who has time is welcome to
join.
