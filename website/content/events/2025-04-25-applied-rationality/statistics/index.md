### 12. What did you like the least?

* **Responses:** 10 people (55.56% of attendees)

**Note:** Anything contained in square brackets [] is an edit by the organizers.

> Hot Seat (didn't think it had much use. Maybe better as a prepared Event so everyone can prepare good questions. Or with pre-printented questions and the option to go away from them any time)

> Die Einleitung zur Hostile Telepathy war etwas zu lang, aber trotzdem nützlich 

> The explanation for the last two activities took maybe longer than it could have.

> Explanation for hostile telepathy was too long.

> Self deception exercises

> median fragerunde

> The ice breaker exercises did not seem relevant for the later methods (since those were individual not group exercises)

> Ooda-too simple

> Hostile Telepath

> The topics discussed did not have much impact for me. I don't feel closer to enlightenment. (sorry! Not meant as an offense! They were well presented.)
