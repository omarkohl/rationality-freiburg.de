## Preparation

None.


## What will we do?

Today there will be a mixed bag of short talks and exercises:

* Rahel will give a presentation on: The magic of the word 'because' and the
  human bias of not utilizing given information.
* Stefan will give an introduction to neurodiversity.
* Omar will present the "Basics of Rationalist Discourse" and will then explain
  and guide you in the application of a simple technique called "Systemization"
  whereby you try to optimize some aspect of your life that is causing friction.
* We will end with a discussion round.


## Organization

You are worried you have nothing to contribute? No worries! Everyone is
welcome!

There always is a mix of German and English speakers and we configure the
discussion rounds so that everyone feels comfortable participating. The primary
language is English.

This meetup will be hosted by Rahel, Stefan and Omar.

There will be snacks and drinks.

We will go and get dinner after the meetup. Anyone who has time is welcome to
join.
