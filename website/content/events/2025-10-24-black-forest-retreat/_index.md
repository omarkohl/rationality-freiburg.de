## What will we do?

We will spend the weekend with a series of workshops, talks and social activities surrounded by the beautiful landscape of the Black Forest. The content will be participant driven in an unconference style. On Friday afternoon we put up daily planners and by Saturday morning the attendees fill them up with session ideas. Some  sessions  are prepared upfront, but when inspiration hits some are just made up on the spot.

Current ideas for sessions include
* Improv Theatre
* How to achieve the flow state
* Effectivly Handling Disagreement
* Sunset Hike
* Board Games

It has 24 beds in total (2-5 per room), a large common room and smaller TV room to use for the workshops.
