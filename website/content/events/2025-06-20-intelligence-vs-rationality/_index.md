## Preparation

None.


## What will we do?

Omar will give an interactive presentation on the topics of intelligence and rationality, what they both are, why they are often confused and why the distinction matters.

* Does IQ measure anything meaningful?
* Why do smart people do dumb things?
* Are there cognitive abilities besides intelligence?

After the presentation we will subdivide into groups and discuss the topics of the presentation.

This event will serve as the introduction to a series of events on the work of American researcher, cognitive scientist and psychologist [Keith Stanovich](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keith_Stanovich), who has extensively studied the cognitive basis of rationality.

## Organization

You are worried you have nothing to contribute? No worries! Everyone is
welcome!

There always is a mix of German and English speakers and we configure the
discussion rounds so that everyone feels comfortable participating. The primary
language is English.

This meetup will be hosted by Omar.

There will be snacks and drinks.

We will go and get dinner after the meetup. Anyone who has time is welcome to
join.
