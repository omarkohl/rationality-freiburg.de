## Important!

* **Registration** is required to participate! Send an email to info@rationality-freiburg.de
* **Costs** are 35€ per person (exceptions and details see below).
* The number of participants is **limited**.
* We advise you to **avoid intensive intellectual activities before the
  workshop**, otherwise you might be too tired. The workshop has a deliberate
  practice component, i.e. exercises with quick returns. This usually requires
  a lot of energy and attention.
* The session will last **4 hours**. If you need to leave earlier, feel free to
  do so!
* Participants are **expected to agree** with the following
  self-characterizations:
  * "I'm open to changing my mind on some of my core beliefs."
  * "I'm happy to delay saying what I think if it can help being cooperative."
  * "I'm ok with trying step-by-step techniques, even if they may feel a bit robotic at first."
  * "If someone says they refuse to give me something I want, then I respect their choice."


## What will we do?

Camille Berger, a **guest coach** who is coming from France specially for this
event, will teach a workshop on "Effectively Handling Disagreement" based on
the following techniques:

* [Deep Canvassing](https://deepcanvass.org/)
* [Street Epistemology](https://www.streetepistemology.com/)
* Narrative Transportation
* [Cooling Conversations (Smart Politics)](https://www.joinsmart.org/)

The goal is to **practice** the ability to **communicate effectively** with
**people who disagree with you**. This includes skills such as managing an
angry interlocutor, creating contact with someone who is hostile and discussing
respectfully yet rigorously.

### About Camille

> I discovered Street Epistemology in 2018. In the rise of polarization and
> fake news, I had identified a tool that helped me have important yet quiet
> discussions on what mattered to me.
>
> But I was soon frustrated by the impracticality of teaching : I couldn’t find
> an intensive, time-efficient way to learn it.
>
> Resolved to take action, I went through a master's degree in cognitive
> science (ENS Paris), in the hope of optimizing and streamlining the learning
> process of conversational techniques. I read as many scientific sources as I
> could find on the topic, in the aim to develop a wide, interdisciplinary,
> scientifically robust understanding of it. These efforts came to fruition in
> March 2024, after several betas, with the Effectively Handling Disagreements
> workshop.

### Costs & Financial Aid

The **base price is 35€ per person**. Out of this, 30€ go to the guest speaker
Camille and 5€ are for the room rental.

If you are a student or otherwise suffer from financial hardship (roughly
meaning you can barely pay for your own housing) you can **pay less or even
come for free!** We don't want money to be a dealbreaker. Simply communicate
this fact in your registration email to info@rationality-freiburg.de .

If after the workshop you feel it was not as good as you expected, Camille is
happy to **reimburse** you the 30€.
