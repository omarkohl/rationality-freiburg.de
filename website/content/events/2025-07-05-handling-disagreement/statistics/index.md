### 12. What did you like the least?

* **Responses:** 10 people (41.67% of attendees)

**Note:** Anything contained in square brackets [] is an edit by the organizers.

> Overall the workshop was way too big for my taste. I would limit it to 10- 12 people. Also when we split the group it was still too big.

> It would probably be better to spread the content out over more time (e.g. multiple sessions). Also some of the exercises would probably benefit from more precise step by step instructions.

> Sometimes it was too less time to dive into some more details about things presented.  
> +1h would have eben perfekt.

> The end kind of petered out

> too short  
> how to be less conflict avoidant would've interested me too

> They speak to fast

> Es fällt mir nichts ein...

> Verpaaste Inhalte durch Zeitmangel

> It was hard to implement some of the changes 

> Not enough breaks, too intense.
