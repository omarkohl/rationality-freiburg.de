## Preparation

None.

## What will we do?

"Everyone has a right to their own opinion." We've all heard this countless times. But when you think about it—where did that proverb come from? And why is it so widely repeated?

This session explores the hidden layers of belief. Not just what we claim to believe, but how those beliefs actually function in our minds. Through interactive exercises and group discussion, we'll examine the difference between different ways of believing.

We'll also look at common sayings and wisdom from various cultures, asking ourselves what to believe and how to interact with it.

No philosophical background needed—just bring your willingness to notice confusion and sit with it for a while. That's where the interesting stuff happens.

## Organization

You are worried you have nothing to contribute? No worries! Everyone is welcome!

There always is a mix of German and English speakers and we configure the discussion rounds so that everyone feels comfortable participating. The primary language is English.

This meetup will be hosted by Ben.

There will be snacks and drinks.

We will go and get dinner after the meetup. Anyone who has time is welcome to join.
