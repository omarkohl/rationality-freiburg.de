## Preparation

None.


## What will we do?

What truly defines the edge of human performance — the body or the mind?
"The Limits of Human Endurance" explores the surprising science behind how far we can really push ourselves, drawing on insights from Alex Hutchinson’s book Endure.

This talk takes audiences inside the fascinating relationship between physiology, psychology, and human potential. We’ll break down the key systems that determine endurance — from the heart, lungs, and muscles to the brain’s role as a "central governor" that protects us from perceived danger. Through compelling research, real-world athlete stories, and breakthrough experiments, we’ll uncover why the brain often calls "stop" long before the body reaches its true limit.

Attendees will learn:

- How the brain and body work together to regulate fatigue
- Why pacing, motivation, pain, and mental resilience shape performance as much as physical training
- Scientific findings on endurance from extreme sports, military training, and everyday life


## Organization

You are worried you have nothing to contribute? No worries! Everyone is
welcome!

There always is a mix of German and English speakers and we configure the
discussion rounds so that everyone feels comfortable participating. The primary
language is English.

This meetup will be hosted by Jakob Demler.

There will be snacks and drinks.

We will go and get dinner after the meetup. Anyone who has time is welcome to
join.
