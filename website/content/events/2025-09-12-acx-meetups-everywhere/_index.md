**Background:** [ACX (Astral Codex Ten)](https://www.astralcodexten.com) is a blog
by Scott Alexander. Once a year he announces "Meetups Everywhere" where fans of
the blog get together. Please join even if you are not (yet) a fan!

## Preparation

Read at least one of the following articles, preferably two:

* [What Is Man, That Thou Art Mindful Of Him?](https://www.astralcodexten.com/p/what-is-man-that-thou-art-mindful)
* [Suddenly, Trait-Based Embryo Selection](https://www.astralcodexten.com/p/suddenly-trait-based-embryo-selection)
* [Bayes For Everyone](https://www.astralcodexten.com/p/bayes-for-everyone)
* [My Heart Of Hearts](https://www.astralcodexten.com/p/my-heart-of-hearts)

Bring written answers to the following questions:

* This I already **knew**
* This I did **not understand**
* This I would like to **discuss**
* These are **my ideas** on the topic

People who did not have time to prepare will read "My Heart Of Hearts" during 
the meetup and only then join a discussion group.


## What will we do?

We will split into discussion groups depending on which article(s) you read and
then discuss the answers the participants brought.

## Organization

You are worried you have nothing to contribute? No worries! Everyone is
welcome!

There always is a mix of German and English speakers and we configure the
discussion rounds so that everyone feels comfortable participating. The primary
language is English.

This meetup will be hosted by Omar.

There will be snacks and drinks.

We will go and get dinner after the meetup. Anyone who has time is welcome to
join.
