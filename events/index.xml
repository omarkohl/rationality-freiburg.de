&lt;p>None (except making yourself some sandwiches 😉).&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="what-will-we-do">What will we do?&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>We will go for an easy hike around Freiburg. Details to be defined.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Read the following texts:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;a href="https://slatestarcodex.com/2014/12/19/nobody-is-perfect-everything-is-commensurable/">Nobody Is Perfect, Everything Is

Economics&lt;/a>&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h2 id="what-will-we-do">What will we do?&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>We will discuss the two texts, play a game called &amp;ldquo;Cambist Booking&amp;rdquo; and discuss
&amp;ldquo;Units of Exchange&amp;rdquo; and their applicability to our lives.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The &amp;ldquo;Cambist Booking&amp;rdquo; game goes like this: each person will get a some cards
with things you might want on them. You’ll go around asking other people what
their cards are, and deciding how to compare the two values – is a sportscar
worth more or less than a year’s vacation? Is an hour long massage worth more
or less than a new album by your favourite band? We’ll pass out the cards at
the start, keeping some in reserve for new arrivals, and spend the time talking
about what we value and why. &lt;/p>
&lt;p>The lessons taught in Units of Exchange are direct applications of extremely
well- established principles from economics and sociology, such as supply and
demand, Pareto curves, value of information, the sunk cost fallacy, and
arbitrage.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>There will be snacks and drinks.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>You can get a headstart by reading the following posts on lesswrong.com.&lt;/p>

&lt;/ul>
&lt;h2 id="what-will-we-do">What will we do?&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>We will continue our discussion on Bayesian thinking while navigating decisions
and how it can help us to avoid many cognitive biases. At the beginning of this
meetup, we will briefly discuss about cognitive biases and Bayes&amp;rsquo; rule with
some examples. You are welcome to bring your personal experience in these two
topics. Followed by that, we will discuss how statistics can be misused to
trick our brains.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>A mathematical background is not necessary, and the goal is to make the subject
very intuitive and simple.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Following the discussion about cognitive biases, we will play some games about
the related topics with the educational purpose of conveying information.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>None.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="what-will-we-do">What will we do?&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>The talk will explain what happens in our body when we are exercising. From
this we will draw conclusions on how to get the maximum positiv effect out of
our invested time. Spoiler alert: To go jogging three times a week for one hour
each is both, highly ineffective, and not enough. The good news is that we can
do better in less time.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This talk is for all who are not into exercising at all up to now but might
also be interesting for others, who want to improve their understanding of the
matter and their efficiency.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>After the talk we will discuss some of the ideas presented and then split into
pairs. Each person in the pair will make a commitment concerning exercise for
the next week and for the next month to the other person. Some form of
communication will be established and each person can then report to their
partner whether they were successful or not after the week/month has passed.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="organization">Organization&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>We will decide on using German or English as the main language depending on the
people who turn up. Just come, we will figure it out! The slides themselves
will be in German, though.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>No preparation required - the talk assumes no familiarity wit the field. If you want to, you could watch / listen to the &lt;a href="https://80000hours.org/podcast/episodes/max-tegmark-ai-and-algorithmic-news-selection/">80000 hours episode with Max Tegmark&lt;/a>, in which he discusses his own motivations for engaging in the field and gives some striking examples of why safety should be seriously considered when developing AI systems.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="what-will-we-do">What will we do?&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>We will hear a beginner-friendly talk on AI (Artificial Intelligence) safety by
robotics researcher &lt;a href="https://benjaminalt.github.io/">Benjamin Alt&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The aim of the talk is to give complete beginners in the field of AI solid intuitions and heuristics for thinking about AI systems from a safety perspective. The talk will provide a brief motivation why AI safety is an important concern, even from a short-term perspective. It will give a brief overview of why AI safety is hard, and what aspects of modern AI systems cause safety issues in the first place. It then covers the fundamentals of the assurance, robustness and alignment aspects of AI safety: How can we make sure that we understand what AI systems do? How can we make sure that they reliably do what we think they do? How can we make sure that the AI system&amp;rsquo;s behavior is compatible with our values and preferences?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>There will be interactive parts of this meetup. In the beginning we will brainstorm questions and concerns together. After the talk, there will be a discussion round (or multiple smaller group discussions, depending on the number of people), in which we will try to make sense of what role AI safety may play in our common future.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>You can get a headstart by reading the following posts on lesswrong.com about
cognitive biases.&lt;/p>

&lt;/ul>
&lt;h2 id="what-will-we-do">What will we do?&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Cognitive biases are mental shortcuts people use to make sense of the world
around them. In other words, these shortcuts or tendencies our brains use to
process information more efficiently. While they can be helpful in some
situations, they can also lead to systematic errors in thinking and
decision-making. These biases can lead people to make judgments that are not
necessarily accurate or fair, affecting how people perceive, interpret,
remember, and ultimately make decisions.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>At the beginning of this meetup, a short presentation will be followed by
discussions about cognitive biases. This exercise aims to learn more about
biases and build strategies on how to avoid them.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Following the discussion about cognitive biases, we will play some serious
games about the same topic. Well, no need to get scared by the name; serious
games are also fun games that are designed for a specific purpose and not only
for entertainment. They are often used for educational purposes or to convey
information.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Optional: Read pages 44 to 56 of the &lt;a href="https://www.rationality.org/files/CFAR_Handbook_2021-01.pdf">CFAR
Handbook&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="what-will-we-do">What will we do?&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>It would be ideal to read the three posts beforehand and note your thoughts and
questions, but feel free to turn up even if that is not the case! We will
summarize each post with a discussion in the meeting.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Afterwards, we will give an introduction to TAPs (Trigger-Action-Plan). TAPs
are a technique to create a new intentional habit or break an unwanted habit to
achieve specific goals.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>TAP focuses on a specific noteworthy external trigger which leads to a very
small action. It uses our knowledge from the standard habit model; the
intentions are implemented with an &amp;lsquo;if-then&amp;rsquo; strategy, while a response is
paired with an external trigger.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In the meeting, we will split the group into pairs, and two people will discuss
and collaborate to develop a personal TAP to achieve a specific goal in the
days after the meetup. We will compare the results and experience in
implementing TAPs in a follow-up meetup.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>There will be snacks and drinks.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Some people reported that the &amp;ldquo;Trusting Experts&amp;rdquo; video was hard to follow. Just
do your best, try to get what you can out of it and bring some of your own
thoughts when and why it&amp;rsquo;s better to trust experts as opposed to your own
judgement and vice versa.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="organization">Organization&lt;/h2>

&lt;p>We will decide on using German or English as the main language depending on the

&lt;h3 id="prepare-hamming-circle">Prepare Hamming circle&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Think about at least one problem or bottleneck you have in any area of your
life that you might want to discuss with the group. Ideally something you might
be willing to accept other people&amp;rsquo;s advice on, even though of course you have
no obligation to do anything anyone suggests.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="what-will-we-do">What will we do?&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>We will discuss each other&amp;rsquo;s thoughts on the above video &amp;lsquo;Trusting experts&amp;rsquo;.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Then we will do one or several rounds of &lt;a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/xAqRkrnjJTMZ6YmZA/appendix-how-to-run-a-successful-hamming-circle">Hamming
circles&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>A Hamming circle is a tool/process for making some kind of progress on some
large, significant bottleneck.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This is slightly vague, because Hamming circles are versatile.
Participants at CFAR workshops have brought, into their Hamming circles,
all sorts of problems and questions and goals. A sampling:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>How to find a spouse&lt;/li>
&lt;li>What to do about my deteriorating relationship with my teenage child&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Is it possible for me, specifically, to have a meaningful impact on
existential risk&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Something just isn&amp;rsquo;t right about my life&lt;/li>
&lt;li>I need to secure $250,000 in seed funding for my startup&lt;/li>
&lt;li>My partner and I keep having the same fight&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Even though I know I need to exercise, I just keep not exercising&lt;/li>
&lt;li>What if everything I&amp;rsquo;m doing is &amp;ldquo;fake&amp;rdquo; and I&amp;rsquo;m only doing it because I feel
like I&amp;rsquo;m &amp;ldquo;supposed&amp;rdquo; to&lt;/li>
&lt;li>I want to go on a trip. It feels important to go on a trip. But I don&amp;rsquo;t
know why, and I don&amp;rsquo;t know where, and I don&amp;rsquo;t know what this trip should be&lt;/li>
&lt;li>I think I want to quit grad school&lt;/li>
&lt;li>I&amp;rsquo;m expected to speak at my father&amp;rsquo;s funeral and I have nothing but
scathing, bitter, angry things to say&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>What happens in a Hamming circle is fairly similar to what happens in a pair
debug, or even when you&amp;rsquo;re just working through your problems in your own
mind. However, the problems tend to be larger or deeper or more confusing or
intractable, with the hope being that people will bring their most pressing
bottleneck.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>(Though bringing something smaller is fine; there shouldn&amp;rsquo;t be moral pressure
to shoulder a heavier problem than one feels ready to handle.)&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The idea is that, for the duration of the circle, instead of having access to
just one brain&amp;rsquo;s power, each participant will instead have 3-5x their usual
working memory, 3-5x their usual wisdom and life experiences, 3-5x their
usual perspective or field-of-view, 3-5x idea generators or problem solving
strategies, etc.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>There will be snacks and drinks.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>&lt;strong>UPDATE 29.09&lt;/strong> We will meet in &amp;ldquo;Kursraum 1&amp;rdquo; of FlexRooms, right next to
Bertholdsbrunnen in the center of Freiburg.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The room has windows to ensure proper ventilation. Masks are optional.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>You are worried you have nothing to contribute? No worries! Everyone is
welcome!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We will decide on using German or English as the main language depending on the
people who turn up. Just come, we will figure it out!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Maybe you also want to join the &lt;a href="https://www.rationality-freiburg.de/events/2022-10-15-hike-with-karlsruhe-rationality/">hike&lt;/a> on the day after this
event!&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="preparation">Preparation&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Select one or two &lt;a href="https://slatestarcodex.com/">SSC (Slate Star Codex)&lt;/a> or &lt;a href="https://astralcodexten.substack.com/">ACX
(Astral Codex Ten)&lt;/a> posts that you
particularly enjoy so you can give a short summary to other participants.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If you need inspiration check the &lt;a href="https://slatestarcodex.com/top-posts/">SSC top
posts&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="what-will-we-do">What will we do?&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>First there will be one or several (depending on the number of people) free
discussion rounds where people can present their favorite SSC/ACX posts and the
discussion can flow from there.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>After the discussion we will play &amp;ldquo;The Falling Drill&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>One of the most important parts of intellectual progress is learning to change
your mind. The first step of changing your mind is realizing that you were
wrong about something. Today we&amp;rsquo;re going to practice that often painful
realization, in a small way and in a low pressure situation. Without this
skill, how can you debate an important issue or confront a challenging topic?
You might argue long after it&amp;rsquo;s clear to others that you&amp;rsquo;ve lost, because
admitting it feels like defeat.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The first lesson any martial artist learns is often how to fall. There are ways
to make the landing easier, but they all start from the knowledge that falling
isn&amp;rsquo;t the worst thing in the world.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>There will be snacks and drinks. After the event we will go and get dinner
somewhere.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>&lt;em>Overton Gymnastics&lt;/em> is named after the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overton_window">Overton
window&lt;/a>, a concept from political
science which describes the set of opinions that are acceptable in public
discourse.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>One person will share a controversial opinion that they hold, the other
participants will ensure they understand that person&amp;rsquo;s position very well,
culminating in an &lt;a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/tag/ideological-turing-tests">ITT (Ideological Turing
Test)&lt;/a> i.e. a
convincing summary of the first person&amp;rsquo;s opinion. Then the next participant
shares a controversial opinion of their own. No discussions allowed.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Afterwards we will &lt;strong>compare our experiences implementing TAPs (Trigger-Action

TAP is a technique for changing habits or reaching goals. You choose a very
specific external trigger and a very small action to do in reaction to that
trigger.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>It would be ideal if you read this beforehand and note your thoughts and
questions, but feel free to turn up even if that is not the case! We will
summarize each post.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Afterwards we will give an introduction to &lt;strong>TAPs (Trigger-Action Planning)&lt;/strong>.
TAP is a technique for changing habits or reaching goals. You choose a very
specific external trigger and a very small action to do in reaction to that
trigger.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We will split into pairs and the partners will collaborate to develop a
personal TAP to implement in the days after the meetup.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In the meetup on &lt;a href="https://www.rationality-freiburg.de/events/meetup-2022-07-08-sequences-tap-result-discussion/">July 8th&lt;/a> we will
compare our experiences implementing TAPs.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>As preparation you can read pages 44 to 56 of the &lt;a href="https://www.rationality.org/files/CFAR_Handbook_2021-01.pdf">CFAR
Handbook&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>There will be snacks and drinks.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Afterwards we will &lt;strong>play a game of double crux&lt;/strong>. Double crux is an exercise
done in pairs where the goal is first to find an issue where you have a
disagreement and then identify the fundamental root cause of that disagreement.
It&amp;rsquo;s not about confrontation or discussing the issue, but &lt;strong>collaborating&lt;/strong> to
find that &lt;em>crux&lt;/em> that is making you disagree. For example two
people might disagree on wearing sandals with socks. After some collaborating
they find that the crux of their disagreement is how much importance they
assign to following tacit social norms. They could then dig even deeper why
these social norms are important or why they feel important. As preparation
you can think of a few &lt;em>controversial&lt;/em> beliefs you may have, so that it will be
quick to find a source of disagreement with your randomly assigned partner.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>There will be snacks and drinks.&lt;/p>

Getting the answer wrong and saying you are only 50% sure (i.e. you are guessing!) is better than getting it wrong while being 70% certain.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>We will meet at 17:00 pm CEST (German time) at the Schwabentor in Freiburg and will walk up the Schloßberg to the Kanonenplatz and then decide where to go next.

&lt;p>Rationality Freiburg ist ein Treffpunkt für LessWrong- oder SSC-Leser sowie für andere an Rationalität (Rationality) interessierte Menschen. Rationality ist der Wunsch, die Welt so zu sehen, wie sie ist, insbesondere mit Hilfe der empirischen Wissenschaften sowie der Entwicklung von Werkzeugen zur Erreichung persönlicher Ziele.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Dieses Treffen soll Neulinge und alle Neugierigen einladen, die wissen wollen, worum es hier geht. Kommt einfach, schaut euch um und lasst euch überraschen!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Es gibt keine feste Tagesordnung, sondern die Möglichkeit, miteinander zu reden und sich kennen zu lernen. Wenn genügend Interesse besteht, werden wir eine Einführung in das Bayes&amp;rsquo;sche Denken geben und zeigen, wie man es im täglichen Leben anwenden kann.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Wir treffen uns um 17:00 Uhr MESZ am Schwabentor in Freiburg und werden den Schloßberg hinauf zum Kanonenplatz gehen und dann entscheiden, wohin wir weitergehen. Wir werden ein Schild dabeihaben auf dem &amp;ldquo;&lt;a href="https://www.rationality-freiburg.de">www.rationality-freiburg.de&lt;/a>&amp;rdquo; steht, damit ihr uns problemlos findet.&lt;/p>
