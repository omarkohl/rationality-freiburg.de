&lt;p>The place for the meetup is still undecided, but it will be some central
location in Freiburg. Please check back later.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>You are worried you have nothing to contribute? No worries! Everyone is
welcome!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We will decide on using German or English as the main language depending on the
people who turn up. Just come, we will figure it out!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Maybe you also want to join the &lt;a href="https://www.rationality-freiburg.de/events/2022-10-15-hike-with-karlsruhe-rationality/">hike&lt;/a> on the day after this
event!&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="what-will-we-do">What will we do?&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>First there will be one or several (depending on the number of people) free
discussion rounds. I suggest everyone prepares one or two &lt;a href="https://slatestarcodex.com/">SSC (Slate Star
Codex)&lt;/a> or &lt;a href="https://astralcodexten.substack.com/">ACX (Astral Codex
Ten)&lt;/a> posts they particularly enjoy. You
can then give a short summary of the post and the discussion can flow from
there.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If you need inspiration check the &lt;a href="https://slatestarcodex.com/top-posts/">SSC top
posts&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>After the discussion we will play &amp;ldquo;The Falling Drill&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>One of the most important parts of intellectual progress is learning to change
your mind. The first step of changing your mind is realizing that you were
wrong about something. Today we&amp;rsquo;re going to practice that often painful
realization, in a small way and in a low pressure situation. Without this
skill, how can you debate an important issue or confront a challenging topic?
You might argue long after it&amp;rsquo;s clear to others that you&amp;rsquo;ve lost, because
admitting it feels like defeat.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The first lesson any martial artist learns is often how to fall. There are ways
to make the landing easier, but they all start from the knowledge that falling
isn&amp;rsquo;t the worst thing in the world.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>There will be snacks and drinks. After the event we will go and get dinner
somewhere.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Maybe you also want to join the &lt;a href="https://www.rationality-freiburg.de/events/2022-10-14-acx-astral-codex-ten-meetup/">ACX meetup&lt;/a> on the evening before
this hike!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This will be a common event with &lt;a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/groups/kw7Zb8DLmZtsK8g3R">Karlsruhe
Rationality&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Details will be published here once the event is closer.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>&lt;strong>IMPORTANT&lt;/strong> Please note that due to the rain the event location has changed!
We will monitor the e-mail for at least the first 20 minutes so please write if
you can&amp;rsquo;t find the place &lt;a href="mailto:info@rationality-freiburg.de">info@rationality-freiburg.de&lt;/a>&lt;/p>

&lt;p>We will &lt;strong>discuss&lt;/strong> three posts from the sequence &lt;a href="https://www.readthesequences.com/Noticing-Confusion-Sequence">Noticing

&lt;p>It would be ideal if you read this beforehand and note your thoughts and
questions, but feel free to turn up even if that is not the case! We will
summarize each post.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Afterwards we will play a round of &lt;em>Overton Gymnastics&lt;/em>. The goal of this
exercise is becoming more comfortable sharing controversial opinions and
tolerating other people&amp;rsquo;s beliefs without starting a discussion.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;em>Overton Gymnastics&lt;/em> is named after the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overton_window">Overton
window&lt;/a>, a concept from political
science which describes the set of opinions that are acceptable in public
discourse.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>One person will share a controversial opinion that they hold, the other
participants will ensure they understand that person&amp;rsquo;s position very well,
culminating in an &lt;a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/tag/ideological-turing-tests">ITT (Ideological Turing
Test)&lt;/a> i.e. a
convincing summary of the first person&amp;rsquo;s opinion. Then the next participant
shares a controversial opinion of their own. No discussions allowed.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>There will be snacks and drinks.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Afterwards we will go and have dinner (and you may engage in the discussions
you were holding back 😉).&lt;/p>

&lt;p>We will meet on Friday, July 8th 2022 at 18:00 pm CEST (German time) at the
end of the bridge in the Stadtgarten in Freiburg. Afterwards we will sit with
picnic blankets somewhere in the park, so even if you are late you can try
finding us. We will carry a cardboard sign saying &amp;ldquo;&lt;a href="https://www.rationality-freiburg.de">www.rationality-freiburg.de&lt;/a>&amp;rdquo;
. The meetup will finish at 20:00 pm CEST and we may go to get dinner

TAP is a technique for changing habits or reaching goals. You choose a very
specific external trigger and a very small action to do in reaction to that
trigger.&lt;/p>

would be best if you read pages 44 to 56 of the &lt;a href="https://www.rationality.org/files/CFAR_Handbook_2021-01.pdf">CFAR

&lt;p>Afterwards we will &lt;strong>play a game of double crux&lt;/strong>. Double crux is an exercise
done in pairs where the goal is first to find an issue where you have a
disagreement and then identify the fundamental root cause of that disagreement.
It&amp;rsquo;s not about confrontation or discussing the issue, but &lt;strong>collaborating&lt;/strong> to
find that &lt;em>crux&lt;/em> that is making you disagree. For example two
people might disagree on wearing sandals with socks. After some collaborating
they find that the crux of their disagreement is how much importance they
assign to following tacit social norms. They could then dig even deeper why
these social norms are important or why they feel important. As preparation
you can think of a few &lt;em>controversial&lt;/em> beliefs you may have, so that it will be
quick to find a source of disagreement with your randomly assigned partner.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>There will be snacks and drinks.&lt;/p>

welcome!&lt;/p>

&lt;p>We will meet on Friday, June 3rd 2022 at 17:00 pm CEST (German time) at the end of the bridge in the Stadtgarten in Freiburg. Afterwards we will sit with picnic blankets somewhere in the park, so even if you are late you can try finding us. We will carry a cardboard sign saying &amp;ldquo;&lt;a href="https://www.rationality-freiburg.de">www.rationality-freiburg.de&lt;/a>&amp;rdquo; . The meetup will finish at 19:00 pm CEST and we may go to get dinner afterwards.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>It would be ideal if you read this beforehand and note your thoughts and questions, but feel free to turn up even if that is not the case! We will summarize each post.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Afterwards we will &lt;strong>play a game of personal calibration&lt;/strong> i.e. a quiz where what is most important is to accurately assess how sure you are about your answer. For example: What is the third largest country of the world by area? China or Brazil? Are you 50%, 60%, 70%, 80%, 90% or 99% sure about your answer? Getting the answer wrong and saying you are only 50% sure (i.e. you are guessing!) is better than getting it wrong while being 70% certain.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>There will be snacks.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Rationality Freiburg ist ein Treffpunkt für LessWrong- oder SSC-Leser sowie für andere an Rationalität (Rationality) interessierte Menschen. Rationality ist der Wunsch, die Welt so zu sehen, wie sie ist, insbesondere mit Hilfe der empirischen Wissenschaften sowie der Entwicklung von Werkzeugen zur Erreichung persönlicher Ziele.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Dieses Treffen soll Neulinge und alle Neugierigen einladen, die wissen wollen, worum es hier geht. Kommt einfach, schaut euch um und lasst euch überraschen!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Es gibt keine feste Tagesordnung, sondern die Möglichkeit, miteinander zu reden und sich kennen zu lernen. Wenn genügend Interesse besteht, werden wir eine Einführung in das Bayes&amp;rsquo;sche Denken geben und zeigen, wie man es im täglichen Leben anwenden kann.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Wir treffen uns um 17:00 Uhr MESZ am Schwabentor in Freiburg und werden den Schloßberg hinauf zum Kanonenplatz gehen und dann entscheiden, wohin wir weitergehen. Wir werden ein Schild dabeihaben auf dem &amp;ldquo;&lt;a href="https://www.rationality-freiburg.de">www.rationality-freiburg.de&lt;/a>&amp;rdquo; steht, damit ihr uns problemlos findet.&lt;/p>
